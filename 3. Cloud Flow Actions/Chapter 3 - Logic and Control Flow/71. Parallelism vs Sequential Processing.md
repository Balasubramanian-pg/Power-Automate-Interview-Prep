Canonical documentation for 71. Parallelism vs Sequential Processing. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 71. Parallelism vs Sequential Processing exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Parallelism and sequential processing are two fundamental approaches to executing tasks in computer systems. The purpose of parallelism is to improve the performance and efficiency of systems by executing multiple tasks concurrently, whereas sequential processing involves executing tasks one after the other. The problem space addressed by parallelism vs sequential processing includes optimizing system performance, reducing processing time, and improving responsiveness.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of parallelism vs sequential processing involves understanding the trade-offs between these two approaches. Parallelism can be achieved through multiple processing units, threads, or distributed systems, allowing for concurrent execution of tasks. In contrast, sequential processing involves a single processing unit executing tasks one after the other. The choice between parallelism and sequential processing depends on the specific use case, system architecture, and performance requirements.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Parallelism | The ability of a system to execute multiple tasks concurrently, improving overall performance and efficiency. |
| Sequential Processing | The execution of tasks one after the other, in a linear sequence, without concurrent execution. |
| Concurrency | The ability of a system to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, improving responsiveness and system utilization. |
| Synchronization | The coordination of access to shared resources in a parallel system to prevent conflicts and ensure data consistency. |
| Thread | A separate flow of execution in a program, allowing for concurrent execution of tasks. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of parallelism vs sequential processing include:
* **Speedup**: The improvement in performance achieved by parallelizing tasks.
* **Scalability**: The ability of a system to handle increased workload or processing demands.
* **Amdahl's Law**: A theoretical limit on the maximum speedup that can be achieved by parallelizing a task.
* **Gustafson's Law**: A observation that the amount of work that can be done in parallel increases with the size of the problem.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for parallelism vs sequential processing involves:
* **Identifying parallelizable tasks**: Determining which tasks can be executed concurrently without conflicts or dependencies.
* **Partitioning tasks**: Dividing tasks into smaller, independent sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel.
* **Synchronizing access to shared resources**: Coordinating access to shared resources to prevent conflicts and ensure data consistency.
* **Load balancing**: Distributing workload evenly across processing units to maximize utilization and minimize idle time.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in parallelism vs sequential processing include:
* **Data parallelism**: Executing the same task on different data elements concurrently.
* **Task parallelism**: Executing different tasks concurrently.
* **Pipelining**: Breaking down a task into a series of stages, each executed concurrently.
* **Master-slave pattern**: Using a master process to coordinate the execution of tasks by multiple slave processes.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in parallelism vs sequential processing include:
* **Over-parallelization**: Creating too many concurrent tasks, leading to increased overhead and decreased performance.
* **Under-parallelization**: Failing to utilize available processing resources, leading to underutilization and decreased performance.
* **Inadequate synchronization**: Failing to coordinate access to shared resources, leading to conflicts and data inconsistencies.
