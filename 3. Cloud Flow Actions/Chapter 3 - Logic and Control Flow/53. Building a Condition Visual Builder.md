# 53. Building a Condition Visual Builder

Canonical documentation for 53. Building a Condition Visual Builder. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 53. Building a Condition Visual Builder exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Condition Visual Builder is designed to simplify the process of creating complex conditional logic statements, making it easier for users to define and manage rules, policies, and decision-making processes. It addresses the problems of readability, maintainability, and scalability associated with traditional text-based conditional statements.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Condition Visual Builder is a graphical interface that allows users to create, edit, and visualize conditional logic statements using a drag-and-drop approach. It consists of a canvas where users can add and arrange visual elements, such as conditions, actions, and operators, to create a flowchart-like representation of the conditional logic.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Condition | A statement that evaluates to true or false, used to determine the flow of the conditional logic |
| Action | A statement that is executed when a condition is met |
| Operator | A symbol used to combine conditions, such as AND, OR, and NOT |
| Rule | A set of conditions and actions that define a specific decision-making process |
| Policy | A collection of rules that govern a particular aspect of a system or process |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Condition Visual Builder include:
* **Declarative programming**: The user defines what they want to happen, rather than how it should happen.
* **Visual representation**: The conditional logic is represented graphically, making it easier to understand and modify.
* **Modularity**: The builder allows users to break down complex conditional logic into smaller, reusable components.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the Condition Visual Builder consists of the following components:
* **Canvas**: The graphical interface where users create and arrange visual elements.
* **Palette**: A library of available conditions, actions, and operators that can be dragged onto the canvas.
* **Properties panel**: A panel that displays the properties and settings of the selected visual element.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in the Condition Visual Builder include:
* **Decision tables**: A table-based representation of conditional logic, where each row represents a specific condition and action.
* **Flowcharts**: A graphical representation of the conditional logic, where each node represents a condition or action.
* **Nested conditions**: Conditions that are nested within other conditions, allowing for more complex logic.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in the Condition Visual Builder include:
* **Overly complex conditional logic**: Conditional logic that is too complex or convoluted, making it difficult to understand and maintain.
* **Duplicate conditions**: Duplicate conditions or actions, which can lead to inconsistencies and errors.
* **Lack of comments or documentation**: Conditional logic that is not properly commented or documented, making it difficult for others to understand.
