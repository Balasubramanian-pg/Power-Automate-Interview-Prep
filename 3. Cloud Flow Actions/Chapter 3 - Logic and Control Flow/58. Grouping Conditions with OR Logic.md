Canonical documentation for 58. Grouping Conditions with OR Logic. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 58. Grouping Conditions with OR Logic exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of grouping conditions with OR logic is to enable the creation of complex conditional statements that can evaluate multiple conditions and return a true or false result based on the presence of at least one true condition. This addresses the problem of needing to make decisions based on multiple, potentially unrelated factors, where the presence of any one factor is sufficient to trigger an action or outcome.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Grouping conditions with OR logic involves using a logical operator (OR) to combine two or more conditions, such that if any one of the conditions is true, the entire expression evaluates to true. This allows for the creation of flexible and dynamic conditional statements that can adapt to changing circumstances.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Condition | A statement or expression that evaluates to true or false |
| OR Logic | A logical operator that combines two or more conditions, returning true if any one condition is true |
| Grouping | The process of combining multiple conditions using logical operators |
| Conditional Statement | A statement that executes an action or returns a value based on the evaluation of one or more conditions |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of grouping conditions with OR logic include:
* The use of logical operators (OR) to combine conditions
* The evaluation of conditions as true or false
* The creation of conditional statements that execute actions or return values based on the evaluation of conditions
* The ability to group multiple conditions using logical operators to create complex conditional statements

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for grouping conditions with OR logic involves using parentheses to group conditions and the OR operator to combine them. For example: `(condition1 OR condition2) OR condition3`. This model allows for the creation of complex conditional statements that are easy to read and understand.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for grouping conditions with OR logic include:
* Using OR logic to combine multiple conditions that are related to a single outcome or action
* Using grouping to create complex conditional statements that evaluate multiple conditions
* Using conditional statements to execute actions or return values based on the evaluation of conditions

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for grouping conditions with OR logic include:
* Using OR logic to combine unrelated conditions, leading to confusing and difficult-to-maintain code
* Failing to use grouping to create complex conditional statements, leading to nested and hard-to-read code
* Using conditional statements that are overly complex or difficult to understand
