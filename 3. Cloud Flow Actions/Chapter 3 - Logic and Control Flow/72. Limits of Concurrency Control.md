> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 72. Limits of Concurrency Control exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 72. Limits of Concurrency Control is to provide a framework for understanding the constraints and boundaries of concurrency control mechanisms in distributed systems, databases, and other parallel computing environments. The problem space addressed by this topic includes issues such as deadlock detection, livelock avoidance, and starvation prevention, which can arise when multiple processes or threads compete for shared resources.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Concurrency control refers to the mechanisms and techniques used to manage access to shared resources in a multi-process or multi-threaded environment. The conceptual overview of 72. Limits of Concurrency Control involves understanding the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and performance in distributed systems, as well as the limitations imposed by the CAP theorem and other fundamental constraints.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Concurrency Control | Mechanisms and techniques used to manage access to shared resources in a multi-process or multi-threaded environment |
| Deadlock | A situation in which two or more processes are blocked indefinitely, each waiting for the other to release a resource |
| Livelock | A situation in which two or more processes are unable to proceed because they are too busy responding to each other's actions |
| Starvation | A situation in which a process is unable to access a shared resource due to other processes holding onto it for an extended period |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 72. Limits of Concurrency Control include understanding the different types of concurrency control mechanisms, such as pessimistic and optimistic locking, as well as the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and performance. Additionally, understanding the fundamental limits imposed by the CAP theorem, which states that it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously guarantee more than two out of the following three properties: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 72. Limits of Concurrency Control involves a combination of concurrency control mechanisms, such as locking, transactions, and replication, to ensure consistency and availability in distributed systems. This model also takes into account the limitations imposed by the CAP theorem and other fundamental constraints, and provides guidelines for designing and implementing concurrency control mechanisms that balance consistency, availability, and performance.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in 72. Limits of Concurrency Control include the use of locking mechanisms, such as semaphore and mutex, to synchronize access to shared resources, as well as the use of transactions to ensure atomicity and consistency in distributed systems. Additionally, patterns such as replication and partitioning are used to improve availability and performance in distributed systems.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in 72. Limits of Concurrency Control include the use of coarse-grained locking, which can lead to performance bottlenecks and scalability issues, as well as the use of unbounded queues, which can lead to resource exhaustion and system crashes. Additionally, anti-patterns such as busy-waiting and polling can lead to wasted CPU cycles and decreased system responsiveness.
