# 54. Left Side Value vs Right Side Value

Canonical documentation for 54. Left Side Value vs Right Side Value. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 54. Left Side Value vs Right Side Value exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The concept of Left Side Value (LSV) and Right Side Value (RSV) exists to provide a clear understanding of the differences between the values assigned to or returned by the left and right sides of an equation, expression, or assignment statement. This concept addresses the class of problems related to variable assignment, data type conversion, and operator precedence in programming languages.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Left Side Value vs Right Side Value concept can be thought of as a fundamental principle in programming, where the left side of an assignment or equation represents the destination or target of the operation, while the right side represents the source or value being assigned or evaluated. Understanding the differences between LSV and RSV is crucial for writing correct, efficient, and effective code.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Left Side Value (LSV) | The value or expression on the left side of an assignment or equation, representing the destination or target of the operation. |
| Right Side Value (RSV) | The value or expression on the right side of an assignment or equation, representing the source or value being assigned or evaluated. |
| Assignment Statement | A statement that assigns a value to a variable, property, or attribute. |
| Expression | A combination of values, operators, and functions that evaluates to a single value. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Left Side Value vs Right Side Value include:
* Variable assignment: The process of assigning a value to a variable, where the LSV is the variable and the RSV is the value being assigned.
* Data type conversion: The process of converting a value from one data type to another, where the LSV is the target data type and the RSV is the source value.
* Operator precedence: The order in which operators are evaluated in an expression, where the LSV and RSV are used to determine the order of operations.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Left Side Value vs Right Side Value is based on the following principles:
* The LSV is always the destination or target of the operation.
* The RSV is always the source or value being assigned or evaluated.
* The data type of the LSV determines the data type of the result.
* The operator precedence rules determine the order of operations.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Left Side Value vs Right Side Value include:
* Assignment statements: `x = 5`, where `x` is the LSV and `5` is the RSV.
* Expression evaluation: `x = 2 + 3`, where `x` is the LSV and `2 + 3` is the RSV.
* Data type conversion: `x = (int) 5.5`, where `x` is the LSV and `(int) 5.5` is the RSV.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Left Side Value vs Right Side Value include:
* Using the same variable as both LSV and RSV: `x = x`, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
* Ignoring operator precedence: `x = 2 + 3 * 4`, which can lead to incorrect results.
* Not checking data type compatibility: `x = (int) "hello"`, which can lead to runtime errors.
