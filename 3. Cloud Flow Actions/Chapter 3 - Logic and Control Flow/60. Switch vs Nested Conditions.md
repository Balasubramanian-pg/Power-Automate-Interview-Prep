# 60. Switch vs Nested Conditions

Canonical documentation for 60. Switch vs Nested Conditions. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 60. Switch vs Nested Conditions exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Switch vs Nested Conditions concept exists to provide an efficient and readable way to handle multiple conditional statements in programming. It addresses the problem of complex, nested if-else statements that can lead to decreased code readability and increased maintenance costs. By using a switch statement, developers can simplify their code and improve its overall structure.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Switch vs Nested Conditions concept revolves around the idea of using a switch statement as an alternative to nested if-else statements. A switch statement allows developers to evaluate an expression and execute a specific block of code based on the expression's value. This approach can simplify complex conditional logic and make the code more efficient.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Switch Statement | A control flow statement that allows developers to execute different blocks of code based on the value of an expression. |
| Nested If-Else Statements | A series of if-else statements nested inside each other to handle multiple conditional statements. |
| Conditional Expression | An expression that evaluates to a value used to determine which block of code to execute. |
| Case Statement | A statement that specifies a value to match against the conditional expression in a switch statement. |
| Default Statement | A statement that specifies a block of code to execute when no match is found in a switch statement. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Switch vs Nested Conditions include:
* Using a switch statement to simplify complex conditional logic
* Evaluating an expression to determine which block of code to execute
* Using case statements to specify values to match against the conditional expression
* Using a default statement to handle unexpected values

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Switch vs Nested Conditions involves using a switch statement with case statements to handle multiple conditional statements. The switch statement should be used when there are multiple values to match against, and the code to execute for each value is relatively simple. Nested if-else statements should be used when the conditional logic is complex and requires multiple levels of nesting.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Switch vs Nested Conditions include:
* Using a switch statement to handle a fixed set of values
* Using nested if-else statements to handle complex conditional logic
* Using a default statement to handle unexpected values
* Using a switch statement with a limited number of case statements to improve readability

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Switch vs Nested Conditions include:
* Using a switch statement with a large number of case statements, making the code difficult to read
* Using nested if-else statements with a large number of levels, making the code difficult to understand
* Not using a default statement in a switch statement, leading to unexpected behavior
* Using a switch statement to handle a dynamic set of values, leading to maintenance issues
