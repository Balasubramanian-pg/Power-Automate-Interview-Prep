# 62. Defining Case Blocks

Canonical documentation for 62. Defining Case Blocks. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 62. Defining Case Blocks exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of defining case blocks is to provide a structured approach to handling different scenarios or conditions within a process or system. This addresses the problem of complexity and ambiguity in decision-making processes, allowing for more efficient and effective management of various cases.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Defining case blocks involves identifying, categorizing, and outlining the specific conditions or scenarios that require distinct handling. This conceptual model consists of a set of predefined cases, each with its own set of rules, actions, and outcomes. The case blocks serve as the foundation for creating a robust and adaptable system that can respond to diverse situations.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Case Block | A predefined set of conditions, rules, and actions that define how to handle a specific scenario or situation. |
| Case Type | A category or classification of cases that share similar characteristics or requirements. |
| Case Instance | A specific occurrence or example of a case type, with its own set of attributes and values. |
| Decision Table | A table or matrix that outlines the possible conditions, actions, and outcomes for a set of case blocks. |
| Rule Engine | A software component that evaluates the conditions and rules defined in the case blocks and determines the appropriate actions to take. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of defining case blocks include:
* **Modularity**: Breaking down complex processes into smaller, manageable case blocks that can be easily maintained and updated.
* **Reusability**: Creating case blocks that can be applied to multiple scenarios or situations, reducing duplication and increasing efficiency.
* **Flexibility**: Designing case blocks that can adapt to changing conditions or requirements, allowing for greater responsiveness and agility.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for defining case blocks typically involves the following steps:
1. **Identify Case Types**: Determine the categories or classifications of cases that require distinct handling.
2. **Define Case Blocks**: Create predefined sets of conditions, rules, and actions for each case type.
3. **Develop Decision Tables**: Outline the possible conditions, actions, and outcomes for each case block.
4. **Implement Rule Engine**: Use a software component to evaluate the conditions and rules defined in the case blocks and determine the appropriate actions to take.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for defining case blocks include:
* **Decision Trees**: Using a tree-like structure to represent the possible conditions and actions for a set of case blocks.
* **State Machines**: Modeling the different states or conditions that a case block can be in, and defining the actions to take for each state.
* **Event-Driven Architecture**: Designing case blocks that respond to specific events or triggers, such as changes in data or user interactions.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for defining case blocks include:
* **Hardcoding**: Embedding case block logic directly into the code, making it difficult to maintain or update.
* **Over-Engineering**: Creating overly complex case blocks that are difficult to understand or manage.
* **Lack of Standardization**: Failing to establish a consistent approach to defining case blocks, leading to confusion and duplication.
