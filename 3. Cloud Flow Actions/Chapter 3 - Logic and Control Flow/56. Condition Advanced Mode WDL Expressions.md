# 56. Condition Advanced Mode WDL Expressions

Canonical documentation for 56. Condition Advanced Mode WDL Expressions. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 56. Condition Advanced Mode WDL Expressions exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Condition Advanced Mode WDL Expressions is designed to provide a flexible and powerful way to define conditional logic in workflows, allowing users to create complex decision-making processes. This feature addresses the need for more advanced conditional statements, enabling the creation of sophisticated workflows that can adapt to various input conditions and scenarios.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Condition Advanced Mode WDL Expressions can be thought of as a conditional statement that evaluates a set of input conditions and returns a boolean value indicating whether the condition is met. This value can then be used to control the flow of the workflow, allowing for more dynamic and responsive workflows.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| WDL | Workflow Description Language, a human-readable and -writeable language for describing workflows |
| Condition | A statement that evaluates to a boolean value, used to control the flow of a workflow |
| Advanced Mode | A mode of operation that allows for more complex conditional statements |
| Expression | A combination of values, operators, and functions that evaluates to a single value |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Condition Advanced Mode WDL Expressions include:
* Conditional statements: used to evaluate input conditions and return a boolean value
* Logical operators: used to combine multiple conditions into a single expression
* Functions: used to perform calculations and transformations on input values
* Variables: used to store and reference values within the workflow

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Condition Advanced Mode WDL Expressions involves using a combination of conditional statements, logical operators, and functions to create complex expressions. This model recommends using clear and concise syntax, with proper indentation and formatting to improve readability.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Condition Advanced Mode WDL Expressions include:
* Using conditional statements to control the flow of the workflow
* Combining multiple conditions using logical operators
* Using functions to perform calculations and transformations on input values
* Storing and referencing values using variables

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Condition Advanced Mode WDL Expressions include:
* Using overly complex conditional statements that are difficult to read and maintain
* Failing to properly indent and format expressions, leading to decreased readability
* Using functions and variables unnecessarily, leading to increased complexity
