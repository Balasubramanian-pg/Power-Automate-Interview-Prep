# 67. Automatic Loop Generation by Power Automate

Canonical documentation for 67. Automatic Loop Generation by Power Automate. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 67. Automatic Loop Generation by Power Automate exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Automatic Loop Generation by Power Automate is to streamline repetitive tasks and workflows by automatically generating loops that can iterate over a set of data, perform actions, and make decisions. This addresses the problem of manual and tedious workflow creation, reducing the time and effort required to automate business processes. The class of problems it addresses includes data processing, document generation, and workflow automation.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Automatic Loop Generation by Power Automate is a feature that enables users to create workflows that can automatically iterate over a set of data, such as a list of items or a database query. This allows users to perform actions on each item in the dataset, such as sending emails, creating documents, or updating records. The loop generation feature uses a set of predefined rules and conditions to determine when to start and stop the loop, and what actions to take on each iteration.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Loop | A sequence of actions that are repeated for each item in a dataset. |
| Iterator | A variable that keeps track of the current item being processed in the loop. |
| Condition | A rule that determines when to start or stop the loop. |
| Action | A task that is performed on each item in the loop. |
| Dataset | A collection of data that is used to generate the loop. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Automatic Loop Generation by Power Automate include:
* **Looping**: The ability to repeat a set of actions for each item in a dataset.
* **Iteration**: The process of keeping track of the current item being processed in the loop.
* **Conditional logic**: The use of rules and conditions to determine when to start or stop the loop.
* **Action execution**: The performance of tasks on each item in the loop.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Automatic Loop Generation by Power Automate involves the following steps:
1. Define the dataset that will be used to generate the loop.
2. Configure the loop settings, including the iterator and condition.
3. Add actions to the loop that will be performed on each item.
4. Test and deploy the workflow.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Automatic Loop Generation by Power Automate include:
* **Data processing**: Using loops to process large datasets, such as extracting data from a database or spreadsheet.
* **Document generation**: Using loops to generate documents, such as invoices or reports.
* **Workflow automation**: Using loops to automate business processes, such as approving or rejecting requests.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Automatic Loop Generation by Power Automate include:
* **Overly complex loops**: Creating loops that are too complex or nested, which can lead to performance issues or errors.
* **Inefficient data processing**: Using loops to process data in an inefficient manner, such as processing each item individually instead of in bulk.
* **Lack of error handling**: Failing to include error handling mechanisms in the loop, which can lead to workflow failures or data corruption.
