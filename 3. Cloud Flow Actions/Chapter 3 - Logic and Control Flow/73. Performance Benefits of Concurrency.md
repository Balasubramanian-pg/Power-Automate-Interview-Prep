# 73. Performance Benefits of Concurrency

Canonical documentation for 73. Performance Benefits of Concurrency. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 73. Performance Benefits of Concurrency exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of concurrency is to improve the performance and responsiveness of systems by executing multiple tasks simultaneously, thereby reducing the overall processing time and enhancing user experience. The problem space addressed by concurrency includes scenarios where sequential execution of tasks leads to performance bottlenecks, slow system response times, and inefficient utilization of system resources.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Concurrency is a programming paradigm that enables multiple tasks to execute concurrently, sharing common resources such as memory, I/O devices, and CPU time. This is achieved through various techniques, including multi-threading, multi-processing, and asynchronous programming. The conceptual model of concurrency involves dividing tasks into smaller, independent units that can be executed simultaneously, improving system throughput and responsiveness.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Concurrency | The ability of a system to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, improving performance and responsiveness. |
| Parallelism | The simultaneous execution of multiple tasks on multiple processing units, such as CPUs or cores. |
| Thread | A lightweight process that can execute concurrently with other threads, sharing common resources. |
| Process | An independent unit of execution that can run concurrently with other processes, having its own memory space and resources. |
| Synchronization | The coordination of access to shared resources by multiple concurrent tasks to prevent conflicts and ensure data consistency. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of concurrency include:
* **Concurrency**: Executing multiple tasks simultaneously to improve system performance and responsiveness.
* **Parallelism**: Executing multiple tasks simultaneously on multiple processing units to improve system throughput.
* **Synchronization**: Coordinating access to shared resources to prevent conflicts and ensure data consistency.
* **Communication**: Exchanging data between concurrent tasks to achieve a common goal.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for concurrency involves:
1. **Task decomposition**: Dividing tasks into smaller, independent units that can be executed concurrently.
2. **Thread or process creation**: Creating threads or processes to execute tasks concurrently.
3. **Synchronization**: Coordinating access to shared resources using synchronization primitives such as locks, semaphores, or monitors.
4. **Communication**: Exchanging data between concurrent tasks using inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms such as pipes, sockets, or shared memory.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in concurrency include:
* **Producer-Consumer**: A pattern where one task produces data and another task consumes it, using a shared buffer to synchronize access.
* **Master-Worker**: A pattern where a master task divides work among multiple worker tasks, which execute concurrently and report results back to the master.
* **Pipeline**: A pattern where tasks are executed in a linear sequence, with each task producing output that is used as input by the next task.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in concurrency include:
* **Busy-waiting**: A task that continuously polls a shared resource, wasting CPU cycles and reducing system responsiveness.
* **Unprotected shared access**: Accessing shared resources without proper synchronization, leading to data corruption and conflicts.
* **Over-synchronization**: Using excessive synchronization primitives, leading to performance bottlenecks and reduced concurrency.
