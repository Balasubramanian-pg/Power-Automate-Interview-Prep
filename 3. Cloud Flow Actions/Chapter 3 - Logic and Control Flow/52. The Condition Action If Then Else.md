# 52. The Condition Action If Then Else

Canonical documentation for 52. The Condition Action If Then Else. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 52. The Condition Action If Then Else exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Condition Action If Then Else exists to provide a logical framework for making decisions based on specific conditions. It addresses the class of problems that require conditional execution of actions, allowing for more dynamic and adaptive systems. This pattern is essential in various domains, including programming, business process management, and decision support systems.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Condition Action If Then Else pattern involves a conditional statement that evaluates a specific condition. If the condition is true, then a specific action is executed (If-Then). If the condition is false, an alternative action is executed (Else). This pattern enables systems to respond differently to varying conditions, promoting flexibility and robustness.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Condition | A statement or expression that can be evaluated as true or false. |
| Action | A specific task or operation that is executed in response to a condition. |
| If-Then | A clause that specifies the action to be taken when the condition is true. |
| Else | A clause that specifies the alternative action to be taken when the condition is false. |
| Decision Table | A table that outlines the conditions, actions, and corresponding outcomes. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Condition Action If Then Else pattern include:
* Conditional evaluation: The ability to assess a condition and determine its truth value.
* Action execution: The ability to perform a specific task or operation in response to a condition.
* Decision-making: The ability to select between alternative actions based on the condition.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the Condition Action If Then Else pattern involves the following components:
* A condition evaluator that assesses the condition and determines its truth value.
* An action executor that performs the specified action based on the condition.
* A decision table that outlines the conditions, actions, and corresponding outcomes.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns that utilize the Condition Action If Then Else pattern include:
* Validation and error handling: Using conditional statements to validate input data and handle errors.
* Business rule implementation: Using conditional statements to implement business rules and decision logic.
* Workflow management: Using conditional statements to manage workflow and direct the flow of activities.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns that should be avoided when using the Condition Action If Then Else pattern include:
* Overly complex conditional statements: Using nested or convoluted conditional statements that are difficult to understand and maintain.
* Unnecessary conditional statements: Using conditional statements when a simpler approach would suffice.
* Inconsistent decision logic: Using inconsistent or contradictory decision logic that can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.
