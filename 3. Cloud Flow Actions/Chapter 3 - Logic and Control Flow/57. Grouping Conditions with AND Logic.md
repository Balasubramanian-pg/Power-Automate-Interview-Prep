# 57. Grouping Conditions with AND Logic

Canonical documentation for 57. Grouping Conditions with AND Logic. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 57. Grouping Conditions with AND Logic exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of grouping conditions with AND logic is to enable the creation of complex conditional statements that require multiple conditions to be met simultaneously. This addresses the problem of needing to filter or validate data based on multiple criteria, which is a common requirement in various fields such as data analysis, business intelligence, and software development.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Grouping conditions with AND logic involves combining two or more conditions using the logical AND operator, which returns true only if all conditions are true. This allows for the creation of nested conditional statements that can be used to filter data, validate user input, or control the flow of a program.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Condition | A statement that evaluates to true or false |
| AND Operator | A logical operator that returns true if all conditions are true |
| Grouping | The process of combining multiple conditions using logical operators |
| Nested Conditions | Conditions that are nested inside other conditions |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of grouping conditions with AND logic include:
* The use of the AND operator to combine conditions
* The creation of nested conditional statements
* The evaluation of conditions as true or false
* The use of grouping to simplify complex conditional statements

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for grouping conditions with AND logic involves using parentheses to group conditions and the AND operator to combine them. For example: `(condition1 AND condition2) AND condition3`.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for grouping conditions with AND logic include:
* Using nested conditions to filter data
* Combining conditions with AND and OR operators to create complex conditional statements
* Using grouping to simplify conditional statements and improve readability

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for grouping conditions with AND logic include:
* Using unnecessary nesting or grouping, which can decrease readability
* Failing to use parentheses to group conditions, which can lead to ambiguous or incorrect results
* Using AND logic with a large number of conditions, which can lead to performance issues
