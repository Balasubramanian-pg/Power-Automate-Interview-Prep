# 61. The On Input in Switch Actions

Canonical documentation for 61. The On Input in Switch Actions. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 61. The On Input in Switch Actions exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The On Input in Switch Actions is a crucial mechanism that enables dynamic and interactive behavior in various applications, particularly those involving user input and conditional logic. It addresses the need for flexible and responsive systems that can adapt to changing user inputs and requirements. The primary problem space includes handling user interactions, managing conditional logic, and ensuring seamless transitions between different application states.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The On Input in Switch Actions can be conceptualized as a trigger-response mechanism, where user input serves as the trigger, and the switch action responds accordingly. This mechanism involves a conditional statement that evaluates the user input and executes a specific action based on the input value. The conceptual overview encompasses the input source, the conditional logic, and the resulting actions, which collectively enable the system to respond dynamically to user interactions.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Switch Action | A specific response or set of responses triggered by a particular user input or condition. |
| On Input | The event or trigger that initiates the evaluation of the conditional logic and subsequent execution of the switch action. |
| Conditional Logic | The set of rules or conditions that determine which switch action to execute based on the user input. |
| Input Source | The origin of the user input, such as a keyboard, mouse, or touch screen. |
| Action Response | The resulting behavior or output of the system in response to the user input and switch action. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the On Input in Switch Actions include:
- **Input Detection**: The ability to recognize and capture user input from various sources.
- **Conditional Evaluation**: The process of assessing the user input against predefined conditions to determine the appropriate switch action.
- **Action Execution**: The execution of the switch action in response to the user input and conditional evaluation.
- **State Management**: The ability to manage and maintain the current state of the system, including the input source, conditional logic, and action response.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the On Input in Switch Actions involves a modular and layered approach, consisting of:
1. **Input Layer**: Responsible for detecting and capturing user input.
2. **Conditional Layer**: Evaluates the user input against predefined conditions.
3. **Action Layer**: Executes the switch action based on the conditional evaluation.
4. **State Management Layer**: Maintains the current state of the system and ensures seamless transitions between different states.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for the On Input in Switch Actions include:
- **Input Validation**: Verifying the user input against predefined rules and constraints.
- **Default Actions**: Specifying default switch actions for unexpected or undefined user input.
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implementing fallback mechanisms to handle errors or exceptions during the execution of switch actions.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for the On Input in Switch Actions include:
- **Tight Coupling**: Directly coupling the input detection, conditional logic, and action execution, making the system inflexible and difficult to maintain.
- **Complex Conditional Logic**: Using overly complex conditional statements, leading to decreased readability and increased error propensity.
- **Insufficient Error Handling**: Failing to implement adequate error handling and fallback mechanisms, resulting in system crashes or unexpected behavior.
