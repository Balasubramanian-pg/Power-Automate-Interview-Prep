# 75. Best Practices for Logic Actions

Canonical documentation for 75. Best Practices for Logic Actions. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 75. Best Practices for Logic Actions exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 75. Best Practices for Logic Actions is to provide a set of guidelines and recommendations for designing, implementing, and maintaining logical actions in various systems, applications, and workflows. The class of problems it addresses includes ensuring consistency, reliability, and efficiency in logical decision-making processes, reducing errors, and improving overall system performance.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Logic actions refer to the processes and rules that govern the behavior of systems, applications, and workflows in response to specific conditions, events, or inputs. The conceptual model of logic actions involves understanding the relationships between inputs, processing, and outputs, as well as the context in which these actions occur. This model encompasses the identification of triggers, conditions, and consequences, and the application of logical operators and rules to produce desired outcomes.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Action | A specific task or operation performed in response to a trigger or condition. |
| Condition | A set of criteria or rules that must be met for an action to be executed. |
| Consequence | The outcome or result of an action. |
| Logic Rule | A statement that defines the relationship between conditions and actions. |
| Trigger | An event or input that initiates an action. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of logic actions include:
* **Modularity**: Breaking down complex logic into smaller, manageable modules.
* **Reusability**: Designing logic actions to be reusable across different contexts and applications.
* **Flexibility**: Allowing for adjustments and modifications to logic actions as requirements change.
* **Scalability**: Ensuring that logic actions can handle increased complexity and volume.
* **Maintainability**: Designing logic actions to be easy to understand, update, and maintain.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for logic actions involves the following components:
1. **Trigger**: An event or input that initiates the logic action.
2. **Condition**: A set of criteria or rules that are evaluated in response to the trigger.
3. **Logic Rule**: A statement that defines the relationship between the condition and the action.
4. **Action**: A specific task or operation performed if the condition is met.
5. **Consequence**: The outcome or result of the action.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in logic actions include:
* **Validation**: Checking input data against predefined rules or criteria.
* **Authorization**: Controlling access to resources or actions based on user identity or role.
* **Notification**: Sending alerts or messages in response to specific events or conditions.
* **Error Handling**: Managing and responding to errors or exceptions that occur during logic action execution.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in logic actions include:
* **Tight Coupling**: Directly linking logic actions to specific implementations or technologies.
* **Complex Conditionals**: Using overly complex or nested conditional statements.
* **Magic Numbers**: Using hardcoded values or constants without clear explanations.
* **Unnecessary Actions**: Performing unnecessary or redundant actions.
