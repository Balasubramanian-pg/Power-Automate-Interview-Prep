## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 65. Apply to Each Loop Core Purpose exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Apply to Each Loop is a fundamental control structure in programming that enables the execution of a set of statements repeatedly for each item in a collection. It exists to simplify the process of iterating over collections, such as arrays, lists, or sets, and performing operations on each element. The primary problem it addresses is the need for a concise and efficient way to process each item in a collection without having to manually manage loop counters or indices.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
At its core, the Apply to Each Loop is about abstraction, encapsulating the iteration logic, and focusing on the operation to be applied to each element. This abstraction allows developers to think in terms of "what" needs to be done to each element rather than "how" to iterate over the collection. It's a key concept in programming that promotes readability, maintainability, and scalability of code.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Iteration | The process of repeating a set of statements for each item in a collection. |
| Collection | A group of items that can be iterated over, such as arrays, lists, or sets. |
| Loop Body | The set of statements that are executed for each item in the collection. |
| Iterator | An object that enables traversal through all the elements in a collection. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Apply to Each Loop include iteration, collection traversal, and the execution of a loop body for each element. Understanding how to declare the loop, manage the iteration process, and access each element within the loop body is crucial. Additionally, concepts like loop variables, which hold the current element being processed, and the termination condition, which determines when the loop should stop, are fundamental.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for an Apply to Each Loop typically involves specifying the collection to iterate over, defining the loop body that will be executed for each element, and optionally, handling any exceptions that may occur during iteration. The loop should be designed to be flexible, allowing for different types of collections and operations to be applied. Best practices include keeping the loop body concise and focused on a single operation to improve code readability and maintainability.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns include using the Apply to Each Loop for data transformation, filtering, or aggregation. For example, calculating the sum of all elements in a collection, converting all strings in a list to uppercase, or filtering out elements that do not meet a certain condition. These patterns are widely recognized and utilized in programming due to their simplicity and effectiveness.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns include using the Apply to Each Loop when a simpler construct like a for loop would suffice, unnecessarily complex loop bodies that decrease readability, and modifying the collection being iterated over within the loop, which can lead to unpredictable behavior or errors. Another anti-pattern is not checking for null or empty collections before attempting to iterate over them, which can result in runtime exceptions.
