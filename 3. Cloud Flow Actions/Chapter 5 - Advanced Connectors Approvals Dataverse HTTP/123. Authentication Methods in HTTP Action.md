# 123. Authentication Methods in HTTP Action

Canonical documentation for 123. Authentication Methods in HTTP Action. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 123. Authentication Methods in HTTP Action exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 123. Authentication Methods in HTTP Action is to provide a standardized approach to authenticating HTTP requests, ensuring the security and integrity of web applications. This addresses the problem of unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats that can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of web-based resources.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of 123. Authentication Methods in HTTP Action involves a client-server architecture, where the client (e.g., web browser or mobile app) sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server verifies the client's identity using various authentication methods. The authentication process involves a series of steps, including credential collection, verification, and session management.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Authentication | The process of verifying the identity of a client or user. |
| Authorization | The process of determining what actions a client or user can perform on a protected resource. |
| Credentials | Information used to verify the identity of a client or user, such as username and password. |
| HTTP Request | A message sent from a client to a server to request a specific resource or action. |
| Session Management | The process of managing the interaction between a client and server, including authentication, authorization, and resource access. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 123. Authentication Methods in HTTP Action include:
* **Authentication protocols**: Standardized protocols, such as Basic Auth, Digest Auth, and OAuth, that define the format and exchange of authentication credentials.
* **Credential storage**: Secure storage of client credentials, such as passwords or tokens, to prevent unauthorized access.
* **Session management**: Techniques for managing the interaction between a client and server, including authentication, authorization, and resource access.
* **Token-based authentication**: Using tokens, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT), to authenticate and authorize clients.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 123. Authentication Methods in HTTP Action involves the following steps:
1. Client requests access to a protected resource.
2. Server responds with an authentication challenge, specifying the required authentication method.
3. Client provides authentication credentials, such as username and password.
4. Server verifies the credentials and authenticates the client.
5. Server grants access to the protected resource and manages the client's session.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in 123. Authentication Methods in HTTP Action include:
* **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Allowing clients to access multiple protected resources with a single set of credentials.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Requiring clients to provide multiple forms of verification, such as password and biometric data.
* **Token-based authentication**: Using tokens to authenticate and authorize clients, reducing the need for repeated credential exchange.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in 123. Authentication Methods in HTTP Action include:
* **Plain text password storage**: Storing client passwords in plain text, rather than hashed or encrypted form.
* **Insecure authentication protocols**: Using outdated or insecure authentication protocols, such as Basic Auth over HTTP.
* **Insufficient session management**: Failing to properly manage client sessions, allowing unauthorized access to protected resources.
