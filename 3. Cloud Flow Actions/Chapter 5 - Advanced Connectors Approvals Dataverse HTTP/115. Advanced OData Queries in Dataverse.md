# 115. Advanced OData Queries in Dataverse

Canonical documentation for 115. Advanced OData Queries in Dataverse. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 115. Advanced OData Queries in Dataverse exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Advanced OData Queries in Dataverse is to provide a standardized mechanism for querying and manipulating data in Dataverse, addressing the need for flexible, efficient, and scalable data access and manipulation. The class of problems it addresses includes complex data querying, data filtering, sorting, and aggregation, as well as data integration and interoperability.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Advanced OData Queries in Dataverse provide a query language for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data in Dataverse. The conceptual model consists of entities, attributes, and relationships, which are used to define the structure and organization of the data. OData queries are used to interact with the data, using a standardized syntax and semantics.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| OData | Open Data Protocol, a standardized protocol for creating and consuming RESTful APIs |
| Dataverse | A cloud-based platform for storing, managing, and integrating data |
| Entity | A logical representation of a real-world object or concept, with attributes and relationships |
| Attribute | A characteristic or property of an entity, such as a name or address |
| Relationship | A connection between two or more entities, such as a customer-order relationship |
| Query | A request for data, using a specific syntax and semantics |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Advanced OData Queries in Dataverse include:
* **Entity Data Model (EDM)**: a conceptual model of the data, consisting of entities, attributes, and relationships
* **OData Query Syntax**: a standardized syntax for creating OData queries, using keywords such as $filter, $select, and $orderby
* **Query Options**: parameters that can be used to customize the query, such as $top and $skip
* **Data Types**: the types of data that can be used in OData queries, such as integers, strings, and dates

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Advanced OData Queries in Dataverse consists of the following components:
* **OData Service**: a RESTful API that provides access to the data in Dataverse
* **Entity Sets**: collections of entities, such as customers or orders
* **OData Queries**: requests for data, using the OData query syntax and semantics
* **Query Results**: the data returned by the OData service, in response to a query

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Advanced OData Queries in Dataverse include:
* **Filtering**: using the $filter keyword to select specific data, based on conditions such as equality or range
* **Sorting**: using the $orderby keyword to sort the data, based on one or more attributes
* **Aggregation**: using the $apply keyword to perform aggregate operations, such as sum or average
* **Paging**: using the $top and $skip keywords to limit the amount of data returned

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Advanced OData Queries in Dataverse include:
* **Using SELECT \***: selecting all attributes, rather than only the attributes that are needed
* **Not using filtering**: retrieving all data, rather than filtering out unnecessary data
* **Not using sorting**: retrieving data in an unsorted order, rather than sorting the data
* **Not using aggregation**: performing aggregate operations on the client-side, rather than using the $apply keyword
