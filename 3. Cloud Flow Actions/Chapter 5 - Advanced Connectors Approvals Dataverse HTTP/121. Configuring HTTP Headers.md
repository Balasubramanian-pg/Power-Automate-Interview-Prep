# 121. Configuring HTTP Headers

Canonical documentation for 121. Configuring HTTP Headers. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 121. Configuring HTTP Headers exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of configuring HTTP headers is to enable efficient, secure, and reliable communication between clients and servers over the HTTP protocol. HTTP headers address a range of problems, including authentication, caching, content negotiation, and security. By configuring HTTP headers, developers can ensure that their web applications are optimized for performance, scalability, and security.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Configuring HTTP headers involves setting and manipulating the metadata that is exchanged between clients and servers as part of the HTTP request and response cycle. This metadata includes information about the request or response, such as the type of content being sent, the language and encoding of the content, and any relevant security or authentication details. By understanding how to configure HTTP headers, developers can better manage the flow of information between clients and servers, and optimize their web applications for improved user experience and security.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| HTTP Header | A key-value pair that is included in an HTTP request or response to provide additional metadata about the request or response. |
| Request Header | An HTTP header that is included in an HTTP request to provide additional context or metadata about the request. |
| Response Header | An HTTP header that is included in an HTTP response to provide additional context or metadata about the response. |
| Header Field | A single key-value pair that is included in an HTTP header. |
| Header Value | The value associated with a particular header field. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of configuring HTTP headers include understanding the different types of HTTP headers, such as request headers, response headers, and entity headers. Developers should also be familiar with the different header fields and their corresponding values, as well as how to set and manipulate these fields using various programming languages and frameworks. Additionally, understanding the HTTP request and response cycle, including the different stages of the cycle and how HTTP headers are exchanged between clients and servers, is essential for effective configuration of HTTP headers.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for configuring HTTP headers involves setting and manipulating header fields using a combination of programming languages, frameworks, and libraries. This typically involves using a server-side programming language, such as Java or Python, to set and manipulate header fields, as well as using a web framework, such as Spring or Django, to provide a structured approach to configuring HTTP headers. Additionally, developers should follow established best practices and guidelines for configuring HTTP headers, such as those provided by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for configuring HTTP headers include using the `Set-Cookie` header to set cookies on the client-side, using the `Authorization` header to authenticate requests, and using the `Cache-Control` header to control caching behavior. Additionally, developers often use the `Content-Type` header to specify the type of content being sent, and the `Accept` header to specify the types of content that are acceptable to the client.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Common anti-patterns for configuring HTTP headers include using the `X-` prefix to create custom header fields, which can lead to namespace collisions and interoperability issues. Additionally, developers should avoid using the `Set-Cookie` header to set cookies that are not essential to the functionality of the web application, as this can lead to security vulnerabilities and privacy concerns. Furthermore, using the `Cache-Control` header to disable caching altogether can lead to performance issues and increased latency.
