# 119. Calling External REST APIs

Canonical documentation for 119. Calling External REST APIs. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 119. Calling External REST APIs exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of calling external REST APIs is to enable communication between different systems, services, or applications over the internet. This allows for the exchange of data, functionality, or services, facilitating integration, scalability, and flexibility. The problem space addressed by calling external REST APIs includes data silos, system fragmentation, and the need for real-time data exchange.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Calling external REST APIs involves sending HTTP requests to a remote server, which processes the request and returns a response. This interaction is based on a request-response model, where the client (e.g., a web application) sends a request to the server, and the server responds with the requested data or an error message. The conceptual overview includes understanding HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), request and response formats (e.g., JSON, XML), and authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth).

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| API | Application Programming Interface: a set of defined rules that enable different applications to communicate with each other. |
| REST | Representational State of Resource: an architectural style for designing networked applications, emphasizing stateless, client-server, cacheable, and uniform interface principles. |
| HTTP | Hypertext Transfer Protocol: a protocol used for transferring data over the internet, providing a foundation for RESTful APIs. |
| Endpoint | A specific URL or URI that defines a resource or service, used to interact with an API. |
| Request | A message sent from a client to a server, containing data, headers, and other information. |
| Response | A message sent from a server to a client, containing data, headers, and other information. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of calling external REST APIs include:
* Understanding HTTP methods and their usage (e.g., GET for retrieving data, POST for creating data).
* Working with request and response formats, such as JSON or XML.
* Implementing authentication mechanisms, like API keys or OAuth, to secure API interactions.
* Handling errors and exceptions, including error codes, messages, and retry mechanisms.
* Managing API rate limits, quotas, and caching to optimize performance.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for calling external REST APIs involves:
* Using HTTP methods to interact with API endpoints.
* Passing data in the request body or query parameters.
* Including authentication information in the request headers or query parameters.
* Handling responses, including parsing data, checking error codes, and handling exceptions.
* Implementing retry mechanisms and caching to improve performance and reliability.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for calling external REST APIs include:
* Using API client libraries or frameworks to simplify interactions.
* Implementing API gateways or proxies to manage traffic, security, and caching.
* Using API documentation tools, such as Swagger or OpenAPI, to define and document APIs.
* Following API design principles, such as RESTful API design, to create consistent and maintainable APIs.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for calling external REST APIs include:
* Using outdated or insecure protocols, such as HTTP instead of HTTPS.
* Not implementing proper error handling, leading to crashes or unexpected behavior.
* Ignoring API rate limits, resulting in blocked or throttled requests.
* Not validating or sanitizing user input, making the API vulnerable to attacks.
* Using overly complex or bespoke API designs, making maintenance and integration difficult.
