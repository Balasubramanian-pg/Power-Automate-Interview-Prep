# 120. HTTP Methods GET POST PUT DELETE

Canonical documentation for 120. HTTP Methods GET POST PUT DELETE. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 120. HTTP Methods GET POST PUT DELETE exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE are fundamental components of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is the foundation of data communication on the web. These methods exist to address the need for a standardized way to interact with resources on the web, enabling clients (such as web browsers) to retrieve, create, update, and delete data on servers. The class of problems they address includes the need for a reliable, efficient, and scalable way to manage resources over the internet.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
At a high level, HTTP methods can be thought of as verbs that define the actions a client can perform on a server's resources. Each method has a specific purpose: GET for retrieving data, POST for creating new data, PUT for updating existing data, and DELETE for deleting data. These methods are the building blocks of RESTful APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and are used in a wide range of web applications, from simple web pages to complex enterprise systems.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| HTTP | Hypertext Transfer Protocol, the standard protocol for transferring data over the web. |
| GET | A request method used to retrieve data from a server. |
| POST | A request method used to create new data on a server. |
| PUT | A request method used to update existing data on a server. |
| DELETE | A request method used to delete data from a server. |
| Resource | An entity that can be addressed and manipulated on a server, such as a file, a database record, or a web page. |
| Client | A program or application that sends requests to a server, such as a web browser. |
| Server | A program or application that receives requests from clients and responds with data, such as a web server. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of HTTP methods include:
- **Idempotence**: The property of an HTTP method that guarantees the same result regardless of how many times it is applied. For example, GET and DELETE are idempotent, while POST is not.
- **Safety**: The property of an HTTP method that guarantees it will not modify the server's state. For example, GET is safe, while PUT and DELETE are not.
- **Request-Response Cycle**: The process by which a client sends a request to a server and receives a response, which includes the HTTP method, headers, and body.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for using HTTP methods is based on the REST (Representational State of Resource) architectural style, which recommends the following:
- Use GET to retrieve resources.
- Use POST to create new resources.
- Use PUT to update existing resources.
- Use DELETE to delete resources.
This model provides a clear and consistent way to interact with resources on the web and is widely adopted in web development.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Some common patterns for using HTTP methods include:
- **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Operations**: Using POST to create, GET to read, PUT to update, and DELETE to delete resources.
- **Resource-Based Routing**: Using HTTP methods to interact with resources based on their URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).
- **API Versioning**: Using HTTP methods to manage different versions of an API.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Some common anti-patterns for using HTTP methods include:
- **Using GET to modify resources**: This can lead to security vulnerabilities and is not idempotent.
- **Using POST to update resources**: This can lead to inconsistencies and is not RESTful.
- **Not handling errors correctly**: Failing to handle errors and exceptions properly can lead to poor user experience and security issues.
