> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 113. Dataverse Update a Row Requirements exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The 113. Dataverse Update a Row Requirements exists to provide a standardized approach to updating existing rows within a Dataverse table, addressing the need for data consistency, integrity, and accuracy. This requirement aims to solve the problem of ensuring that changes to data are properly validated, authorized, and recorded, thereby maintaining the reliability and trustworthiness of the data stored in Dataverse.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of 113. Dataverse Update a Row Requirements involves understanding the Dataverse data model, which comprises tables, rows, and columns. Updating a row in Dataverse entails modifying the values of one or more columns within that row, while ensuring that the changes comply with the defined data validation rules, access controls, and data governance policies.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Dataverse | A cloud-based platform for storing, managing, and analyzing data. |
| Table | A collection of related data within Dataverse, comprising rows and columns. |
| Row | A single record or entry within a Dataverse table, representing a set of values for each column. |
| Column | A vertical element in a Dataverse table, defining a field or attribute of the data. |
| Update | The act of modifying the value of one or more columns within a row. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 113. Dataverse Update a Row Requirements include:
- **Data Validation**: Ensuring that the updated values conform to the defined data types, formats, and ranges.
- **Access Control**: Verifying that the user or process updating the row has the necessary permissions and authorization.
- **Data Governance**: Adhering to the established policies and procedures for data management, including audit trails and version control.
- **Transaction Management**: Handling updates as transactions, which can be committed or rolled back, to maintain data consistency.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for updating a row in Dataverse involves the following steps:
1. **Retrieve the row**: Fetch the row to be updated from the Dataverse table.
2. **Validate the updates**: Check the new values against the defined data validation rules.
3. **Apply access control**: Verify the user's or process's permissions to update the row.
4. **Perform the update**: Modify the row with the new values, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
5. **Commit the transaction**: Save the changes, or roll back if any errors occur.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for updating rows in Dataverse include:
- **Batch updates**: Updating multiple rows in a single operation, which can improve performance and reduce the overhead of individual updates.
- **Scheduled updates**: Automating updates to occur at regular intervals, such as daily or weekly, to maintain data freshness and consistency.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for updating rows in Dataverse include:
- **Direct SQL updates**: Bypassing the Dataverse API and using direct SQL queries to update rows, which can circumvent data validation and access control.
- **Unmanaged transactions**: Failing to properly manage transactions, leading to data inconsistencies and potential losses.
