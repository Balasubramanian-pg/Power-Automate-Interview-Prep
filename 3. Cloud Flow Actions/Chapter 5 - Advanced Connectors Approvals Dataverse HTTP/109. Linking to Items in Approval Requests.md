> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 109. Linking to Items in Approval Requests exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of linking to items in approval requests is to provide a seamless and efficient way to reference and access relevant information during the approval process. This feature addresses the problem of manual searching, information siloing, and lack of transparency in traditional approval workflows. By enabling links to items, approvers can quickly access and review necessary documents, data, or other relevant items, streamlining the approval process and reducing errors.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of linking to items in approval requests involves a network of interconnected elements, including approval requests, items, and links. Approval requests represent the container for the approval process, while items represent the individual elements that require approval, such as documents, records, or tasks. Links establish relationships between these elements, enabling approvers to navigate and access relevant information efficiently.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approval Request | A formal request for approval of one or more items. |
| Item | A single element that requires approval, such as a document, record, or task. |
| Link | A reference or connection between an approval request and an item. |
| Approver | An individual or entity responsible for reviewing and approving items. |
| Workflow | A series of activities, tasks, or processes that facilitate the approval process. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of linking to items in approval requests include:
* **Itemization**: The process of breaking down complex approval requests into individual items.
* **Linking**: The act of establishing relationships between approval requests and items.
* **Accessibility**: The ability of approvers to easily access and review linked items.
* **Transparency**: The visibility of the approval process, including linked items and approval history.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for linking to items in approval requests involves the following components:
* **Approval Request Template**: A predefined template that outlines the structure and content of an approval request.
* **Item Repository**: A centralized storage location for items that require approval.
* **Linking Mechanism**: A tool or feature that enables the creation and management of links between approval requests and items.
* **Workflow Engine**: A system that automates and manages the approval process, including the routing of approval requests and linked items.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for linking to items in approval requests include:
* **Item-based approval**: Approving individual items within an approval request.
* **Batch approval**: Approving multiple items within a single approval request.
* **Conditional approval**: Approving items based on specific conditions or criteria.
* **Escalation**: Escalating approval requests to higher-level approvers or authorities.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for linking to items in approval requests include:
* **Manual searching**: Manually searching for items or information during the approval process.
* **Information siloing**: Storing items or information in isolated or inaccessible locations.
* **Lack of transparency**: Failing to provide clear visibility into the approval process or linked items.
* **Insufficient auditing**: Failing to maintain accurate records of approval history and linked items.
