> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 105. Approval Type First to Respond exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Approval Type First to Respond is designed to streamline approval processes by assigning tasks to the first available responder, thereby reducing wait times and increasing overall efficiency. This approach addresses the problem of delayed approvals due to lack of clear assignment or unavailability of designated approvers.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Approval Type First to Respond operates on a simple yet effective principle: when an approval request is generated, it is immediately assigned to the first available approver who meets the predefined criteria. This could be based on role, seniority, or any other relevant factor. The system ensures that the approval request is routed to an available responder as quickly as possible, facilitating timely decision-making.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approval Request | A formal request for approval of a particular action, decision, or document. |
| First to Respond | The first approver to become available and accept the approval request. |
| Approval Type | A categorization of approvals based on their nature, such as financial, operational, or strategic. |
| Assignment Rule | A predefined set of criteria used to determine which approver should receive the approval request. |
| Approval Workflow | The sequence of steps and decisions involved in the approval process. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Approval Type First to Respond include the dynamic assignment of approval requests, the importance of responder availability, and the need for clear, predefined assignment rules. These concepts work together to ensure that approval requests are handled efficiently and effectively.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Approval Type First to Respond involves the following steps:
1. **Generation of Approval Request**: An approval request is created and entered into the system.
2. **Assignment to First Available Responder**: The system assigns the approval request to the first available approver based on predefined assignment rules.
3. **Notification of Assignment**: The assigned approver is notified of the approval request.
4. **Review and Decision**: The approver reviews the request and makes a decision.
5. **Notification of Outcome**: The outcome of the approval request is communicated to relevant parties.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in the implementation of Approval Type First to Respond include:
- **Role-Based Assignment**: Approval requests are assigned based on the role of the approver.
- **Escalation Procedures**: If an approver is unavailable, the approval request is escalated to the next available approver.
- **Time-Based Rules**: Approval requests are assigned based on time-sensitive criteria, such as the urgency of the request.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns to avoid in the implementation of Approval Type First to Respond include:
- **Static Assignment**: Assigning approval requests to specific individuals without considering their availability.
- **Lack of Clear Assignment Rules**: Failing to define clear, predefined criteria for assigning approval requests.
- **Insufficient Notification**: Not notifying approvers or requesters of the status of approval requests in a timely manner.
