> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 102. Start and Wait for an Approval Action exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of the Start and Wait for an Approval Action is to provide a standardized mechanism for initiating and awaiting approval from authorized entities within a business process. This addresses the class of problems related to workflow management, where tasks require explicit approval before proceeding. The Start and Wait for an Approval Action exists to ensure that approvals are properly requested, tracked, and acted upon, thereby maintaining the integrity and consistency of the workflow.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Start and Wait for an Approval Action involves a requester initiating an approval request, which is then sent to the approver for review. The approver evaluates the request and responds with either an approval or rejection. The requester's workflow is then updated accordingly, allowing the process to proceed or be terminated as necessary. This high-level model encompasses the key elements of approval requests, approver evaluation, and workflow updates.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approval Action | A specific activity that requires explicit approval from an authorized entity before proceeding. |
| Approver | An individual or entity authorized to evaluate and respond to approval requests. |
| Requester | The individual or entity initiating the approval request. |
| Workflow | A series of tasks or activities that are coordinated and managed to achieve a specific goal. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Start and Wait for an Approval Action include:
- **Approval Requests**: The act of initiating a request for approval, which includes providing necessary context and information for the approver to make an informed decision.
- **Approver Evaluation**: The process by which the approver reviews the approval request and makes a decision to either approve or reject it.
- **Workflow Integration**: The mechanism by which the outcome of the approval action is integrated back into the workflow, allowing the process to proceed accordingly.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the Start and Wait for an Approval Action involves the following steps:
1. **Initiation**: The requester initiates the approval request.
2. **Submission**: The approval request is submitted to the approver.
3. **Evaluation**: The approver evaluates the request.
4. **Response**: The approver responds with either an approval or rejection.
5. **Update**: The workflow is updated based on the approver's response.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for the Start and Wait for an Approval Action include:
- **Sequential Approval**: Approval requests are sent to approvers in a sequential manner, where each approver must respond before the request is sent to the next.
- **Parallel Approval**: Approval requests are sent to multiple approvers simultaneously, where the request is considered approved if a specified number of approvers respond with approval.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for the Start and Wait for an Approval Action include:
- **Lack of Transparency**: Failing to provide clear context and information with the approval request, leading to confusion and delays.
- **Inconsistent Approval Criteria**: Using inconsistent or unclear criteria for evaluating approval requests, leading to inconsistent outcomes.
