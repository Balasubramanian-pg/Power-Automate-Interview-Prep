Canonical documentation for 114. Dataverse List Rows Action. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 114. Dataverse List Rows Action exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The 114. Dataverse List Rows Action is designed to retrieve a list of rows from a specified table in Dataverse, addressing the need for data retrieval and manipulation in various applications, such as data integration, business intelligence, and custom applications. This action solves the problem of accessing and retrieving data from Dataverse tables, enabling developers to build robust and data-driven solutions.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The 114. Dataverse List Rows Action is a fundamental component in the Dataverse ecosystem, allowing developers to fetch data from tables and use it in their applications. This action is typically used in conjunction with other Dataverse actions, such as Create, Update, and Delete, to provide a comprehensive data management solution. The action takes input parameters, such as the table name and filter criteria, and returns a list of rows that match the specified conditions.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Dataverse | A cloud-based platform for storing and managing data |
| Table | A collection of related data in Dataverse |
| Row | A single record in a Dataverse table |
| Filter Criteria | Conditions used to narrow down the data retrieved from a table |
| Action | A reusable block of code that performs a specific task, such as listing rows |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the 114. Dataverse List Rows Action include:
* **Data Retrieval**: The action retrieves data from a specified table in Dataverse.
* **Filtering**: The action allows developers to apply filter criteria to narrow down the data retrieved.
* **Pagination**: The action supports pagination, enabling developers to retrieve large datasets in smaller chunks.
* **Error Handling**: The action provides error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions and errors that may occur during data retrieval.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the 114. Dataverse List Rows Action involves the following steps:
1. **Authentication**: Authenticate with the Dataverse platform using credentials or tokens.
2. **Table Selection**: Specify the table from which to retrieve data.
3. **Filter Criteria**: Apply filter criteria to narrow down the data retrieved.
4. **Pagination**: Specify pagination parameters, such as page size and page number.
5. **Data Retrieval**: Execute the action to retrieve the data from the specified table.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for the 114. Dataverse List Rows Action include:
* **Data Integration**: Using the action to integrate data from Dataverse with other applications or services.
* **Business Intelligence**: Using the action to retrieve data for business intelligence and analytics purposes.
* **Custom Applications**: Using the action to build custom applications that interact with Dataverse data.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for the 114. Dataverse List Rows Action include:
* **Overretrieval**: Retrieving more data than necessary, leading to performance issues and unnecessary data transfer.
* **Inadequate Error Handling**: Failing to handle errors and exceptions properly, leading to application crashes or data corruption.
* **Insecure Authentication**: Using insecure authentication methods, such as hardcoded credentials, to authenticate with the Dataverse platform.
