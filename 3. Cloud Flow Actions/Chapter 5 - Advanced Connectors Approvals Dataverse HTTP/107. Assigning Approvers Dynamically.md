> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 107. Assigning Approvers Dynamically exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Assigning Approvers Dynamically is to provide a flexible and efficient way to manage approval workflows in various business processes. The problem space it addresses includes the need for dynamic assignment of approvers based on changing organizational structures, roles, and responsibilities. This is particularly important in environments where approval requirements are complex, and the traditional static assignment of approvers is insufficient.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Assigning Approvers Dynamically involves a rules-based system that evaluates a set of predefined conditions and assigns approvers accordingly. This approach enables organizations to create approval workflows that are adaptable to different scenarios and can be easily updated as business needs evolve. The conceptual overview includes the identification of approval requirements, the definition of rules for dynamic assignment, and the integration with existing workflow management systems.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approver | An individual or entity responsible for reviewing and approving a request or document. |
| Dynamic Assignment | The process of assigning approvers based on predefined rules and conditions that can change over time. |
| Approval Workflow | A series of steps involved in the approval process, including submission, review, and approval or rejection. |
| Rule Engine | A software component that evaluates predefined rules and conditions to determine the approvers for a given request or document. |
| Conditional Logic | A set of rules and conditions used to determine the approvers based on various factors such as user role, department, or document type. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Assigning Approvers Dynamically include:
- **Rule-based assignment**: The use of predefined rules and conditions to determine the approvers.
- **Conditional logic**: The application of logical conditions to evaluate and assign approvers.
- **Dynamic updates**: The ability to update approval workflows and rules in real-time to reflect changing business needs.
- **Integration with workflow management systems**: The seamless integration of dynamic approval assignment with existing workflow management systems.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Assigning Approvers Dynamically involves the following components:
1. **Rule Engine**: A central component that evaluates predefined rules and conditions.
2. **Approval Workflow Engine**: A component responsible for managing the approval workflow, including submission, review, and approval or rejection.
3. **User Directory**: A repository of user information, including roles, departments, and other relevant details.
4. **Rule Repository**: A storage system for predefined rules and conditions.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Assigning Approvers Dynamically include:
- **Role-based assignment**: Assigning approvers based on user roles or positions within the organization.
- **Department-based assignment**: Assigning approvers based on the department or team responsible for the request or document.
- **Document-type-based assignment**: Assigning approvers based on the type of document or request being submitted.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Assigning Approvers Dynamically include:
- **Static assignment**: Assigning approvers manually or using a static list, which can lead to inefficiencies and errors.
- **Overly complex rules**: Creating rules that are too complex or difficult to maintain, which can lead to confusion and errors.
- **Lack of auditing and logging**: Failing to maintain a record of approval assignments and changes, which can lead to compliance issues and difficulties in tracking changes.
