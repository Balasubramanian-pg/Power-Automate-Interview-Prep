# 118. HTTP Connector Core Purpose

Canonical documentation for 118. HTTP Connector Core Purpose. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 118. HTTP Connector Core Purpose exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The 118. HTTP Connector Core Purpose exists to facilitate standardized communication between systems over the internet, addressing the need for a reliable and efficient method of exchanging data between disparate applications and services. The class of problems it addresses includes enabling seamless integration of web services, ensuring data consistency, and providing a scalable and secure means of data exchange.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The 118. HTTP Connector Core Purpose can be conceptualized as a bridge between systems, enabling the exchange of data through standardized HTTP requests and responses. This bridge facilitates communication between web servers, applications, and services, allowing for the retrieval, creation, update, and deletion of resources.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| HTTP | Hypertext Transfer Protocol, a standard protocol for transferring data over the internet |
| Connector | A component that enables communication between systems or applications |
| Resource | A discrete entity that can be addressed and manipulated through HTTP requests |
| Request | A message sent from a client to a server to perform a specific action |
| Response | A message sent from a server to a client in response to a request |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the 118. HTTP Connector Core Purpose include:
* **Standardization**: Adherence to standardized HTTP protocols and methods to ensure interoperability between systems
* **Resource-based architecture**: Organization of data and functionality around discrete resources that can be addressed and manipulated through HTTP requests
* **Stateless communication**: Each request contains all the information necessary to complete the request, eliminating the need for server-side session management

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the 118. HTTP Connector Core Purpose involves a client-server architecture, where:
* The client initiates requests to the server using standardized HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* The server processes the request and returns a response to the client
* The client and server communicate using a standardized protocol (e.g., HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2)

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in the 118. HTTP Connector Core Purpose include:
* **CRUD operations**: Creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources using standardized HTTP methods
* **Resource nesting**: Organizing resources in a hierarchical structure to facilitate navigation and discovery
* **Error handling**: Using standardized HTTP status codes and error responses to handle exceptions and errors

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in the 118. HTTP Connector Core Purpose include:
* **Tight coupling**: Directly referencing or relying on internal implementation details of another system or service
* **Non-standard protocols**: Using non-standard or proprietary protocols for communication between systems
* **Inconsistent resource naming**: Using inconsistent or ambiguous naming conventions for resources and endpoints
