> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 103. Pausing Flow Execution for Human Input exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Pausing flow execution for human input is a crucial aspect of workflow design, as it enables the incorporation of human decision-making, judgment, and expertise into automated processes. This functionality addresses the class of problems where automated workflows require manual intervention, validation, or input to proceed. By pausing the execution of a workflow, human operators can review, modify, or provide additional information, ensuring that the process is accurate, compliant, and effective.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of pausing flow execution for human input involves a workflow engine that orchestrates a series of automated tasks. At specific points in the workflow, the engine pauses execution and waits for human input, which can take the form of approvals, data entry, or other types of interactions. Once the human input is received, the workflow engine resumes execution, incorporating the provided information into the ongoing process. This model relies on a feedback loop between the automated workflow and human operators, ensuring that the process is both efficient and effective.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Human Task | A workflow activity that requires human input, judgment, or decision-making. |
| Workflow Engine | A software component responsible for orchestrating and executing automated workflows. |
| Pause Point | A specific point in a workflow where execution is paused, waiting for human input. |
| Input Gateway | A mechanism that captures and processes human input, providing it to the workflow engine. |
| Resume Point | A specific point in a workflow where execution resumes after human input has been received. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of pausing flow execution for human input include:
* **Human-in-the-loop**: The integration of human decision-making and judgment into automated workflows.
* **Asynchronous processing**: The ability of a workflow engine to pause execution and wait for human input, without blocking or terminating the process.
* **Input validation**: The verification and validation of human input to ensure accuracy, completeness, and consistency.
* **Error handling**: The detection and handling of errors or exceptions that occur during human input or workflow execution.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for pausing flow execution for human input involves the following components:
1. **Workflow definition**: A formal description of the workflow, including tasks, pause points, and input gateways.
2. **Workflow engine**: A software component responsible for executing the workflow and managing pause points.
3. **Human task management**: A mechanism for assigning, tracking, and managing human tasks.
4. **Input gateway**: A mechanism for capturing and processing human input.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for pausing flow execution for human input include:
* **Approval workflows**: Workflows that require human approval or validation at specific points.
* **Data entry workflows**: Workflows that require human input for data collection or processing.
* **Exception handling**: Workflows that pause execution in response to errors or exceptions, requiring human intervention.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for pausing flow execution for human input include:
* **Overly complex workflows**: Workflows with too many pause points or human tasks, leading to inefficiency and confusion.
* **Insufficient input validation**: Failure to validate human input, resulting in errors or inconsistencies.
* **Inadequate error handling**: Failure to detect and handle errors or exceptions, leading to workflow failures or terminations.
