## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 125. Premium Licensing for HTTP Actions exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 125. Premium Licensing for HTTP Actions is to provide a standardized framework for managing and enforcing licenses for HTTP actions, addressing the need for secure, scalable, and flexible licensing mechanisms in modern web applications. This framework aims to solve the problems of license management, including license key generation, validation, and revocation, as well as providing a robust and secure way to protect intellectual property and prevent unauthorized use.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of 125. Premium Licensing for HTTP Actions involves a licensing framework that integrates with HTTP actions to provide a secure and scalable licensing mechanism. This framework consists of a license server, a license client, and a licensing protocol that enables secure communication between the client and server. The licensing framework provides features such as license key generation, validation, and revocation, as well as support for various licensing models, including perpetual, subscription-based, and pay-per-use.
