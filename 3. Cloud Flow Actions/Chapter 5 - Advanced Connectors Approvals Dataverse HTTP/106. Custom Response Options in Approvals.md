> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 106. Custom Response Options in Approvals exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Custom Response Options in Approvals is to provide a flexible and configurable way to manage approval processes, allowing organizations to tailor their approval workflows to specific business needs. This addresses the problem of inflexible approval processes that do not account for unique organizational requirements, leading to inefficiencies and potential bottlenecks.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Custom Response Options in Approvals enable the creation of customized approval workflows by allowing users to define specific response options for approvers. This high-level model consists of three primary components: 
1. **Approval Processes**: The overall workflow that requires approval.
2. **Response Options**: The customizable choices available to approvers.
3. **Conditional Logic**: The rules that determine the next steps based on the selected response options.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approval Process | A series of steps that require approval from one or more individuals. |
| Response Option | A customizable choice available to an approver, such as "Approve," "Reject," or "Request Changes." |
| Conditional Logic | Rules that determine the next steps in an approval process based on the selected response option. |
| Approver | An individual who has the authority to approve or reject a request. |
| Workflow | The sequence of tasks and approvals required to complete a process. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Custom Response Options in Approvals include:
- **Flexibility**: The ability to tailor approval workflows to specific business needs.
- **Configurability**: The capacity to define custom response options and conditional logic.
- **Scalability**: The ability to adapt approval processes to changing organizational requirements.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Custom Response Options in Approvals involves the following steps:
1. **Define Approval Process**: Identify the series of steps that require approval.
2. **Configure Response Options**: Define custom response options for each approval step.
3. **Establish Conditional Logic**: Determine the next steps based on the selected response options.
4. **Assign Approvers**: Designate individuals with the authority to approve or reject requests.
5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Continuously monitor the approval process and make adjustments as needed.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Custom Response Options in Approvals include:
- **Serial Approval**: A linear approval process where each step must be approved before proceeding to the next.
- **Parallel Approval**: A process where multiple approvers can review and approve a request simultaneously.
- **Escalation**: A process where a request is automatically escalated to a higher-level approver if not approved within a specified timeframe.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Custom Response Options in Approvals include:
- **Overly Complex Approval Processes**: Approval workflows that are too intricate, leading to confusion and delays.
- **Insufficient Approval Levels**: Approval processes that do not provide adequate checks and balances.
