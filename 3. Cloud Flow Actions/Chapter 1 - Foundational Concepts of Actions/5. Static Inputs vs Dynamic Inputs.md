Canonical documentation for 5. Static Inputs vs Dynamic Inputs. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 5. Static Inputs vs Dynamic Inputs exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of understanding static inputs vs dynamic inputs is to effectively manage and process user inputs in various applications, systems, and software. This topic addresses the class of problems related to input handling, data processing, and system responsiveness. It helps developers and designers create more efficient, scalable, and user-friendly systems by distinguishing between static and dynamic inputs.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Static inputs refer to predefined, unchanging data that is provided to a system, whereas dynamic inputs are user-generated, variable, and often unpredictable. This fundamental distinction has significant implications for system design, performance, and usability. A deep understanding of static and dynamic inputs enables the creation of more robust, adaptable, and responsive systems.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Static Input | Predefined, unchanging data provided to a system, such as configuration files or hardcoded values. |
| Dynamic Input | User-generated, variable, and often unpredictable data, such as user input from forms or sensors. |
| Input Validation | The process of verifying that user input conforms to expected formats and ranges. |
| Input Sanitization | The process of removing or escaping special characters from user input to prevent security vulnerabilities. |
| Real-time Processing | The ability of a system to process and respond to dynamic inputs in a timely and efficient manner. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of static inputs vs dynamic inputs include:
* **Input classification**: Distinguishing between static and dynamic inputs to determine the appropriate processing and handling mechanisms.
* **Input validation and sanitization**: Ensuring that dynamic inputs are valid, secure, and conform to expected formats.
* **System responsiveness**: Designing systems to respond efficiently and effectively to dynamic inputs, while maintaining performance and scalability.
* **Data processing**: Developing strategies for processing and storing static and dynamic inputs, including data storage, retrieval, and analysis.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for handling static and dynamic inputs involves:
1. **Input reception**: Receiving and parsing user input, whether static or dynamic.
2. **Input validation and sanitization**: Verifying and securing dynamic inputs to prevent errors and security vulnerabilities.
3. **Input processing**: Processing and storing static and dynamic inputs, using appropriate data structures and algorithms.
4. **System response**: Responding to dynamic inputs in a timely and efficient manner, while maintaining system performance and scalability.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for handling static and dynamic inputs include:
* **Using configuration files for static inputs**: Storing static inputs in configuration files or databases for easy maintenance and updates.
* **Implementing input validation and sanitization libraries**: Using established libraries and frameworks to validate and sanitize dynamic inputs.
* **Utilizing real-time processing frameworks**: Leveraging frameworks and technologies that support real-time processing and responsive system design.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for handling static and dynamic inputs include:
* **Hardcoding static inputs**: Embedding static inputs directly in code, making maintenance and updates more difficult.
* **Ignoring input validation and sanitization**: Failing to verify and secure dynamic inputs, leading to security vulnerabilities and system errors.
* **Using inefficient data structures**: Choosing data structures that are not optimized for static or dynamic input handling, resulting in performance issues and scalability problems.
