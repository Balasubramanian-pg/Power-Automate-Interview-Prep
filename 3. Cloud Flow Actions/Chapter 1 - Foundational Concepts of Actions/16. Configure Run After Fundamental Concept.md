# 16. Configure Run After Fundamental Concept

Canonical documentation for 16. Configure Run After Fundamental Concept. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 16. Configure Run After Fundamental Concept exists and the class of problems it addresses. The Configure Run After Fundamental Concept is designed to address the need for a standardized approach to configuring and managing dependencies between tasks, jobs, or workflows in a variety of contexts, including software development, data processing, and business process automation. This concept aims to provide a flexible and scalable framework for defining and executing complex workflows, ensuring that tasks are executed in the correct order and that dependencies are properly managed.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic. The Configure Run After Fundamental Concept revolves around the idea of defining a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of tasks, where each task represents a unit of work that needs to be executed. The DAG is used to model the dependencies between tasks, ensuring that tasks are executed in the correct order and that the overall workflow is properly coordinated. This conceptual model provides a foundation for understanding the Configure Run After Fundamental Concept and its application in various contexts.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Task | A unit of work that needs to be executed, such as a software build, a data processing job, or a business process step. |
| Dependency | A relationship between two tasks, where the execution of one task depends on the completion of another task. |
| Workflow | A directed acyclic graph (DAG) of tasks, representing the overall process or pipeline that needs to be executed. |
| Run After | A specific type of dependency that defines the order in which tasks are executed, where one task is executed after the completion of another task. |
| Configuration | The process of defining and managing the dependencies between tasks, including the specification of the Run After relationships. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic. The Configure Run After Fundamental Concept is based on the following core concepts:
* Tasks and dependencies: The idea that tasks are the basic building blocks of a workflow, and that dependencies between tasks need to be properly managed.
* Directed acyclic graph (DAG): The use of a DAG to model the dependencies between tasks, ensuring that tasks are executed in the correct order.
* Run After relationships: The specific type of dependency that defines the order in which tasks are executed.
* Configuration and management: The process of defining and managing the dependencies between tasks, including the specification of the Run After relationships.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model. The standard model for the Configure Run After Fundamental Concept involves the following components:
* Task definitions: A clear definition of each task, including its inputs, outputs, and dependencies.
* Dependency management: A mechanism for managing the dependencies between tasks, including the specification of the Run After relationships.
* Workflow definition: A clear definition of the overall workflow, including the tasks, dependencies, and Run After relationships.
* Execution engine: A mechanism for executing the workflow, including the tasks and dependencies.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns. The following patterns are commonly used in the context of the Configure Run After Fundamental Concept:
* Linear workflow: A workflow where tasks are executed in a linear sequence, with each task depending on the completion of the previous task.
* Parallel workflow: A workflow where multiple tasks are executed in parallel, with each task depending on the completion of a common predecessor task.
* Conditional workflow: A workflow where tasks are executed conditionally, based on the outcome of previous tasks.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices. The following anti-patterns are commonly observed in the context of the Configure Run After Fundamental Concept:
* Tight coupling: The practice of tightly coupling tasks together, making it difficult to modify or replace individual tasks without affecting the entire workflow.
* Overly complex workflows: The practice of creating overly complex workflows, making it difficult to understand and manage the dependencies between tasks.
* Lack of standardization: The practice of not standardizing task definitions, dependencies, and workflows, making it difficult to compare and contrast different workflows.
