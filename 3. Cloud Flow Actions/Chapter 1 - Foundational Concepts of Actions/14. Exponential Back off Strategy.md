## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 14. Exponential Back off Strategy exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Exponential Back off Strategy exists to handle network failures, server crashes, and other transient errors that may occur in distributed systems, cloud computing, and other networked applications. It addresses the problem of repeated failed attempts to access a resource, which can lead to cascading failures, increased latency, and decreased system reliability.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Exponential Back off Strategy is a fault-tolerant technique that involves increasing the delay between consecutive attempts to access a resource after a failure. The delay grows exponentially with each subsequent failure, allowing the system to recover from temporary errors and reducing the likelihood of overwhelming the system with repeated requests.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Exponential Back off | A strategy for handling failures by increasing the delay between attempts exponentially |
| Retry | An attempt to access a resource after a previous failure |
| Back off | The delay between consecutive retry attempts |
| Base Delay | The initial delay between retry attempts |
| Back off Factor | The multiplier used to increase the delay between retry attempts |
| Maximum Delay | The maximum allowed delay between retry attempts |
| Jitter | A random variation added to the delay to prevent synchronized retries |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The Exponential Back off Strategy relies on the following core concepts:
* **Exponential growth**: The delay between retry attempts increases exponentially with each failure.
* **Randomization**: Adding jitter to the delay helps prevent synchronized retries and reduces the likelihood of cascading failures.
* **Boundaries**: The strategy includes boundaries, such as the maximum delay, to prevent the delay from growing indefinitely.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Exponential Back off involves the following steps:
1. Initialize the base delay and back off factor.
2. Attempt to access the resource.
3. If the attempt fails, calculate the new delay using the exponential back off formula: `delay = base_delay * (back_off_factor ^ attempt_number) + jitter`.
4. Wait for the calculated delay before the next attempt.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the maximum delay is reached or the attempt is successful.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for implementing the Exponential Back off Strategy include:
* **Linear back off**: Using a linear increase in delay instead of exponential growth.
* **Decorrelated jitter**: Using a randomization technique to add jitter to the delay.
* **Circuit breakers**: Combining the Exponential Back off Strategy with circuit breakers to detect and prevent cascading failures.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for the Exponential Back off Strategy include:
* **No back off**: Not implementing any back off strategy, leading to repeated failed attempts and potential cascading failures.
* **Fixed delay**: Using a fixed delay between attempts, which can lead to synchronized retries and decreased system reliability.
* **Unbounded growth**: Allowing the delay to grow indefinitely, leading to potential system hangs or freezes.
