# 23. Redaction in Run History

Canonical documentation for 23. Redaction in Run History. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 23. Redaction in Run History exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Redaction in Run History is to provide a mechanism for protecting sensitive information within the context of workflow or process execution histories. This is particularly important in environments where data privacy and security are paramount, such as financial transactions, healthcare records, or legal proceedings. The problem space includes the need to balance the requirement for detailed execution histories for auditing, debugging, and optimization purposes with the necessity of hiding sensitive data that could be exposed within these histories.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Redaction in Run History involves the systematic removal or masking of sensitive information from the records of process or workflow executions. This can include data such as personal identifiable information (PII), financial data, or other confidential details that are processed during the execution of a workflow or business process. The conceptual model encompasses the identification of sensitive data, the application of redaction rules, and the storage and management of redacted execution histories.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Redaction | The process of removing or obscuring sensitive information from documents or, in this context, execution histories. |
| Run History | A record of the execution of a workflow or business process, including inputs, outputs, and any errors that occurred. |
| Sensitive Information | Data that is confidential, proprietary, or otherwise requires protection from unauthorized access. |
| Redaction Rule | A defined policy or set of policies that dictate what information should be redacted and how it should be redacted. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Redaction in Run History include:
- **Identification of Sensitive Information**: The ability to recognize and classify data that needs to be protected.
- **Application of Redaction Rules**: The process of applying defined policies to remove or mask sensitive information.
- **Storage and Management of Redacted Histories**: The secure storage and controlled access to execution histories after redaction.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Redaction in Run History typically involves a multi-step process:
1. **Data Identification**: Identify the types of sensitive information that need to be redacted.
2. **Rule Definition**: Define the redaction rules based on the identified sensitive information.
3. **Redaction Application**: Apply the redaction rules to the execution histories.
4. **Storage and Access Control**: Store the redacted histories securely and implement access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can view the redacted information.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Redaction in Run History include:
- **Automated Redaction**: Using automated tools and algorithms to identify and redact sensitive information.
- **Manual Review**: Having human reviewers inspect execution histories to ensure the accuracy and completeness of redaction.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combining automated redaction with manual review for sensitive or high-risk data.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Redaction in Run History include:
- **Inconsistent Redaction**: Applying redaction rules inconsistently across different execution histories or workflows.
- **Over-Redaction**: Redacting too much information, potentially obscuring important details necessary for auditing or debugging.
- **Under-Redaction**: Failing to redact all sensitive information, leaving data vulnerable to unauthorized access.

## 8. References
Provide exactly five authoritative external references.
1. **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**: Guidelines for Redacting Sensitive Information from Electronic Documents.
2. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Regulations on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data.
