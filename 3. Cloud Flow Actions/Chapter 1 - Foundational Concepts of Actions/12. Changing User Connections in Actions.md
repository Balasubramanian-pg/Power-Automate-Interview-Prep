# 12. Changing User Connections in Actions

Canonical documentation for 12. Changing User Connections in Actions. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 12. Changing User Connections in Actions exists and the class of problems it addresses. The primary purpose of changing user connections in actions is to manage and modify the relationships between users and the actions they perform within a system. This functionality addresses the problem of dynamically updating user permissions, access control, and workflow assignments in response to changing user roles, responsibilities, or organizational structures. By providing a mechanism to change user connections, systems can ensure that users have the appropriate level of access and functionality to perform their tasks efficiently and effectively.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic. Changing user connections in actions involves a set of processes and components that work together to manage user relationships with actions. This includes user authentication, authorization, and access control mechanisms, as well as the ability to update and modify these relationships in real-time. The conceptual model consists of three primary components: users, actions, and connections. Users represent the individuals or entities that interact with the system, actions represent the tasks or functions that can be performed, and connections represent the relationships between users and actions.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| User | An individual or entity that interacts with the system |
| Action | A task or function that can be performed within the system |
| Connection | A relationship between a user and an action, defining the user's access and permissions |
| Role | A set of connections and permissions that define a user's responsibilities and access level |
| Permission | A specific right or privilege granted to a user to perform an action |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic. The core concepts of changing user connections in actions include:
* User management: the process of creating, updating, and deleting user accounts and their associated connections
* Connection management: the process of creating, updating, and deleting connections between users and actions
* Access control: the process of granting or denying permissions to users to perform actions
* Role-based access control: the process of assigning roles to users and managing the connections and permissions associated with each role

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model. The standard model for changing user connections in actions involves a centralized user management system that integrates with a role-based access control mechanism. This model includes the following components:
* User repository: a centralized store of user information and connections
* Role repository: a centralized store of role definitions and associated connections and permissions
* Access control engine: a component that evaluates user requests and grants or denies access based on the user's connections and permissions

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns. Common patterns for changing user connections in actions include:
* User self-service: allowing users to manage their own connections and permissions
* Administrative management: providing administrators with the ability to manage user connections and permissions
* Automated provisioning: using automated processes to assign connections and permissions to users based on their role or other criteria

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices. Anti-patterns for changing user connections in actions include:
* Hardcoding user connections and permissions: this approach can lead to inflexibility and maintenance issues
* Using a single, monolithic role: this approach can lead to overly broad permissions and reduced security
* Failing to implement access control: this approach can lead to unauthorized access and security breaches
