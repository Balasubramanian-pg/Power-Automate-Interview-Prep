# 20. Building Try Catch Blocks with Run After

Canonical documentation for 20. Building Try Catch Blocks with Run After. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 20. Building Try Catch Blocks with Run After exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Building Try Catch Blocks with Run After is to provide a robust error handling mechanism that allows for the execution of specific code blocks after a try-catch block, ensuring that resources are properly released and system stability is maintained. This approach addresses the class of problems related to resource leaks, data corruption, and system crashes that can occur when errors are not properly handled.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of Building Try Catch Blocks with Run After involves a try-catch block that encloses the main code execution, followed by a finally block that contains the run-after code. This ensures that the run-after code is executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not, providing a reliable way to release resources and perform cleanup operations.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Try Block | A code block that contains the main execution code and is enclosed in a try-catch statement. |
| Catch Block | A code block that handles exceptions thrown by the try block. |
| Run After | A code block that is executed after the try-catch block, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. |
| Finally Block | A code block that is used to contain the run-after code and is executed after the try-catch block. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Building Try Catch Blocks with Run After include:
* Enclosing the main code execution in a try block to catch any exceptions that may be thrown.
* Using a catch block to handle exceptions and prevent system crashes.
* Implementing a finally block to contain the run-after code and ensure its execution.
* Ensuring that resources are properly released and system stability is maintained.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Building Try Catch Blocks with Run After involves:
1. Creating a try block to enclose the main code execution.
2. Implementing a catch block to handle exceptions.
3. Using a finally block to contain the run-after code.
4. Ensuring that the run-after code is executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Building Try Catch Blocks with Run After include:
* Using a try-catch-finally block to ensure that resources are properly released.
* Implementing a catch block to handle specific exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.
* Using a finally block to perform cleanup operations and maintain system stability.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Building Try Catch Blocks with Run After include:
* Not implementing a catch block to handle exceptions, leading to system crashes.
* Not using a finally block to contain the run-after code, resulting in resource leaks.
* Catching general exceptions instead of specific exceptions, making it difficult to diagnose and handle errors.
