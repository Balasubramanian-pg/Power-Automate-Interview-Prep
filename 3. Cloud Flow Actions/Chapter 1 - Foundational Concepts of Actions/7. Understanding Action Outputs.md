> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 7. Understanding Action Outputs exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Understanding Action Outputs is to provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing and interpreting the results of actions, decisions, or processes. This topic addresses the class of problems related to understanding the consequences, outcomes, and effects of actions, enabling individuals and organizations to make informed decisions, optimize processes, and improve overall performance.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Understanding Action Outputs involves a cyclical process of planning, execution, observation, and evaluation. It encompasses the identification of inputs, processing, and transformation of these inputs into outputs, and the assessment of the resulting outcomes. This conceptual model recognizes that actions can have multiple outputs, including intended and unintended consequences, and that these outputs can be measured, evaluated, and used to inform future decisions.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Action | A deliberate task or set of tasks performed to achieve a specific goal or objective. |
| Output | The direct result of an action, including products, services, or changes to a system or process. |
| Outcome | The consequence or effect of an output, including the impact on stakeholders, systems, or the environment. |
| Evaluation | The systematic assessment of the quality, effectiveness, and impact of an action's outputs and outcomes. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Understanding Action Outputs include:
* **Causality**: The relationship between actions and their resulting outputs and outcomes.
* **Context**: The circumstances, conditions, and environment in which actions are taken and outputs are produced.
* **Feedback**: The process of using output and outcome data to inform and improve future actions.
* **Iteration**: The repetitive cycle of planning, execution, and evaluation to refine and optimize actions and processes.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Understanding Action Outputs involves the following stages:
1. **Planning**: Define the action, identify the desired outputs and outcomes, and establish evaluation criteria.
2. **Execution**: Perform the action, generate outputs, and collect data on the resulting outcomes.
3. **Evaluation**: Assess the quality, effectiveness, and impact of the outputs and outcomes.
4. **Feedback and Iteration**: Use the evaluation results to inform and improve future actions.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Understanding Action Outputs include:
* **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly evaluating and refining actions to optimize outputs and outcomes.
* **Output-Based Evaluation**: Focusing on the direct results of actions to assess their effectiveness.
* **Outcome-Based Evaluation**: Emphasizing the consequences and impact of outputs to determine their value and significance.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Understanding Action Outputs include:
* **Lack of Evaluation**: Failing to assess the outputs and outcomes of actions, leading to uninformed decision-making.
* **Output-Only Focus**: Overemphasizing the direct results of actions, while neglecting their broader consequences and impact.
* **Insufficient Feedback**: Failing to use evaluation results to inform and improve future actions.
