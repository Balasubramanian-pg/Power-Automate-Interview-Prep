# 21. Secure Inputs for Sensitive Data

Canonical documentation for 21. Secure Inputs for Sensitive Data. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 21. Secure Inputs for Sensitive Data exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of Secure Inputs for Sensitive Data is to protect sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal identifiable information (PII), from unauthorized access or exposure. This is achieved by implementing secure input mechanisms that prevent malicious activities like eavesdropping, tampering, and phishing. The class of problems addressed by Secure Inputs for Sensitive Data includes data breaches, identity theft, and financial fraud, which can have severe consequences for individuals and organizations.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of Secure Inputs for Sensitive Data involves a multi-layered approach to protecting sensitive information. This includes using secure protocols for data transmission, implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, and ensuring that sensitive data is encrypted and stored securely. Additionally, secure input mechanisms, such as password managers and two-factor authentication, are used to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Sensitive Data | Information that is confidential, proprietary, or personally identifiable, and requires protection from unauthorized access or exposure. |
| Secure Input | A mechanism for entering sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, in a way that prevents unauthorized access or exposure. |
| Encryption | The process of converting plaintext data into unreadable ciphertext to protect it from unauthorized access. |
| Authentication | The process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system to ensure that only authorized access is granted. |
| Authorization | The process of determining what actions a user, device, or system is permitted to perform on a system or resource. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Secure Inputs for Sensitive Data include:
* Confidentiality: protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access or exposure
* Integrity: ensuring that sensitive information is not modified or tampered with
* Authentication: verifying the identity of users, devices, or systems
* Authorization: determining what actions are permitted for authorized users, devices, or systems
* Encryption: protecting sensitive information using cryptographic techniques

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Secure Inputs for Sensitive Data involves a combination of the following components:
* Secure protocols for data transmission, such as HTTPS or SFTP
* Robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication or role-based access control
* Encryption of sensitive data, both in transit and at rest
* Secure input mechanisms, such as password managers or two-factor authentication
* Regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Secure Inputs for Sensitive Data include:
* Using password managers to generate and store unique, complex passwords
* Implementing two-factor authentication to provide an additional layer of security
* Using secure protocols for data transmission, such as HTTPS or SFTP
* Encrypting sensitive data, both in transit and at rest
* Conducting regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Secure Inputs for Sensitive Data include:
* Using weak or default passwords
* Storing sensitive information in plaintext or using weak encryption
* Failing to implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms
* Not conducting regular security audits or penetration testing
* Using outdated or unsupported software or protocols
