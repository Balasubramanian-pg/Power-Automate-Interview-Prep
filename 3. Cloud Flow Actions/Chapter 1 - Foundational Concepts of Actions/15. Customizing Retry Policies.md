# 15. Customizing Retry Policies

Canonical documentation for 15. Customizing Retry Policies. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 15. Customizing Retry Policies exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of customizing retry policies is to provide a flexible and robust mechanism for handling transient failures in distributed systems, allowing developers to define strategies for retrying failed operations. This addresses the problem of ensuring reliable communication and data exchange in the presence of network failures, server crashes, and other temporary errors.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Customizing retry policies involves defining a set of rules and parameters that govern how an application retries failed operations. This includes specifying the number of retries, the delay between retries, and the conditions under which retries are attempted. The goal is to balance the need for reliability with the risk of overwhelming the system with repeated attempts.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Retry Policy | A set of rules and parameters that define how an application retries failed operations |
| Retry Attempt | A single attempt to retry a failed operation |
| Backoff Strategy | A strategy for increasing the delay between retry attempts to avoid overwhelming the system |
| Exponential Backoff | A backoff strategy that increases the delay between retry attempts exponentially |
| Circuit Breaker | A pattern for detecting when a service is not responding and preventing further requests from being sent |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of customizing retry policies include:
* **Retry policies**: defining the rules and parameters for retrying failed operations
* **Backoff strategies**: specifying how the delay between retry attempts is increased to avoid overwhelming the system
* **Circuit breakers**: detecting when a service is not responding and preventing further requests from being sent
* **Idempotence**: ensuring that retrying an operation multiple times has the same effect as retrying it once

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for customizing retry policies involves:
1. Defining a retry policy that specifies the number of retries and the delay between retries
2. Implementing a backoff strategy to increase the delay between retry attempts
3. Using a circuit breaker to detect when a service is not responding
4. Ensuring that operations are idempotent to prevent unintended side effects

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for customizing retry policies include:
* **Exponential backoff**: increasing the delay between retry attempts exponentially
* **Linear backoff**: increasing the delay between retry attempts linearly
* **Randomized backoff**: introducing randomness into the delay between retry attempts to avoid synchronized retries

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for customizing retry policies include:
* **Retry storms**: retrying failed operations too aggressively, leading to overwhelming the system
* **Infinite retries**: retrying failed operations indefinitely, leading to resource exhaustion
* **Lack of idempotence**: failing to ensure that operations are idempotent, leading to unintended side effects
