Canonical documentation for 4. Understanding Action Inputs. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 4. Understanding Action Inputs exists and the class of problems it addresses. Action inputs are a crucial aspect of automating tasks, as they enable the dynamic configuration of actions based on specific requirements. The primary purpose of understanding action inputs is to provide a flexible and reusable way to interact with various systems, applications, and services. The problem space addressed by action inputs includes the need for standardized input handling, input validation, and error handling mechanisms.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic. Action inputs can be thought of as a set of parameters or variables that are passed to an action, influencing its behavior and outcome. These inputs can be categorized into different types, such as user-provided inputs, system-generated inputs, and environmental inputs. Understanding action inputs requires a deep understanding of the action's functionality, input formats, and validation rules.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Action | A self-contained piece of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. |
| Input | A parameter or variable passed to an action, influencing its behavior and outcome. |
| Input Type | A categorization of inputs based on their source, format, or purpose (e.g., user-provided, system-generated). |
| Validation Rule | A set of constraints or checks applied to an input to ensure its correctness and consistency. |
| Error Handling | The process of detecting, reporting, and recovering from input-related errors or exceptions. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic. The core concepts of action inputs include:
* **Input parameterization**: The ability to pass inputs to an action, allowing for dynamic configuration and customization.
* **Input validation**: The process of checking inputs against a set of predefined rules or constraints to ensure their correctness and consistency.
* **Error handling**: The mechanism for detecting, reporting, and recovering from input-related errors or exceptions.
* **Input normalization**: The process of transforming inputs into a standardized format, ensuring consistency and interoperability.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model. The standard model for action inputs involves the following components:
* **Input definition**: A clear and concise definition of the input parameters, including their name, type, and purpose.
* **Input validation**: A set of validation rules applied to the inputs to ensure their correctness and consistency.
* **Error handling**: A well-defined error handling mechanism for detecting, reporting, and recovering from input-related errors or exceptions.
* **Input processing**: The actual processing of the inputs, including any necessary transformations or normalization.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns. Common patterns for action inputs include:
* **User-provided input**: Inputs provided by the user, such as configuration settings or data entries.
* **System-generated input**: Inputs generated by the system, such as logs or metrics.
* **Environmental input**: Inputs influenced by the environment, such as time zones or language settings.
* **Input chaining**: The practice of passing outputs from one action as inputs to another action.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices. Anti-patterns for action inputs include:
* **Hardcoding inputs**: The practice of embedding input values directly into the action code, making it inflexible and difficult to maintain.
* **Lack of input validation**: The failure to apply validation rules to inputs, leading to errors and inconsistencies.
* **Inconsistent error handling**: The use of inconsistent or ad-hoc error handling mechanisms, making it difficult to diagnose and recover from errors.
