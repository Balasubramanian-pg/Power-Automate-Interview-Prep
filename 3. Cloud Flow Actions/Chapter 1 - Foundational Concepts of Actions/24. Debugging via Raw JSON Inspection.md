Canonical documentation for 24. Debugging via Raw JSON Inspection. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 24. Debugging via Raw JSON Inspection exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Debugging via Raw JSON Inspection is a diagnostic technique used to identify and resolve issues in systems that exchange or process JSON data. The primary purpose of this technique is to provide developers with a straightforward method to inspect and analyze JSON data in its raw, unprocessed form. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with complex systems, APIs, or data pipelines where JSON data is used for communication or storage. By inspecting raw JSON data, developers can quickly identify data inconsistencies, formatting issues, or other problems that may be causing errors or unexpected behavior in their applications.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of Debugging via Raw JSON Inspection involves understanding the flow of JSON data through a system, identifying potential points of failure or error, and using various tools or techniques to inspect and analyze the raw JSON data. This may involve using debuggers, log files, or other diagnostic tools to capture and display JSON data in a human-readable format. The goal is to gain a clear understanding of how the JSON data is being processed, transformed, or manipulated, and to identify any issues or inconsistencies that may be causing problems.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| JSON | JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data interchange format |
| Raw JSON | Unprocessed, unmodified JSON data in its original form |
| Inspection | The process of examining or analyzing JSON data to identify issues or problems |
| Debugger | A tool or software component used to debug and diagnose issues in a system |
| Log File | A file that contains records of events, errors, or other system activity |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Debugging via Raw JSON Inspection include understanding the structure and syntax of JSON data, being able to identify and access relevant debuggers or diagnostic tools, and knowing how to analyze and interpret raw JSON data. Additionally, developers should be familiar with common issues or problems that can occur when working with JSON data, such as formatting errors, data type mismatches, or encoding issues.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Debugging via Raw JSON Inspection typically involves the following steps:
1. Identify the source of the JSON data and the point at which it is being processed or transformed.
2. Use a debugger or diagnostic tool to capture and display the raw JSON data.
3. Analyze the JSON data to identify any issues or inconsistencies.
4. Use the results of the analysis to diagnose and resolve the problem.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Debugging via Raw JSON Inspection include:
* Using debuggers or diagnostic tools to capture and display raw JSON data
* Analyzing log files or system records to identify errors or issues related to JSON data
* Using JSON validation or formatting tools to identify issues with JSON syntax or structure
* Implementing custom logging or debugging mechanisms to capture and display JSON data

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Debugging via Raw JSON Inspection include:
* Relying solely on visual inspection of JSON data to identify issues
* Failing to use debuggers or diagnostic tools to capture and display raw JSON data
* Ignoring or overlooking common issues or problems related to JSON data
* Using inadequate or insufficient logging or debugging mechanisms
