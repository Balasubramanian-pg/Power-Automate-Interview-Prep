# 19. Handling Timed Out Actions

Canonical documentation for 19. Handling Timed Out Actions. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 19. Handling Timed Out Actions exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Handling Timed Out Actions is a critical aspect of system design, as it enables developers to manage and respond to actions that fail to complete within a specified time frame. This is essential in distributed systems, networked applications, and other environments where timeouts can occur due to various factors such as network congestion, server overload, or resource unavailability. The primary problem that Handling Timed Out Actions addresses is the need to detect and handle timeouts in a way that ensures system reliability, prevents data corruption, and minimizes the impact on user experience.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of Handling Timed Out Actions involves a timeout detection mechanism, a response strategy, and a recovery process. The timeout detection mechanism monitors the elapsed time of an action and triggers a timeout event when the specified time limit is exceeded. The response strategy determines the course of action to take when a timeout occurs, such as retrying the action, canceling it, or notifying the user. The recovery process ensures that the system returns to a stable state after a timeout, which may involve rolling back transactions, releasing resources, or updating system state.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Timeout | A condition that occurs when an action fails to complete within a specified time frame. |
| Timeout Detection | The process of monitoring the elapsed time of an action and triggering a timeout event when the specified time limit is exceeded. |
| Response Strategy | A plan or approach for handling a timeout, such as retrying the action, canceling it, or notifying the user. |
| Recovery Process | The process of returning the system to a stable state after a timeout, which may involve rolling back transactions, releasing resources, or updating system state. |
| Retry Policy | A set of rules that govern when and how to retry a timed-out action, such as the number of retries, the delay between retries, and the conditions under which to abandon the retry attempt. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Handling Timed Out Actions include:
* **Timeout detection**: The ability to detect when an action has timed out, which is critical for triggering a response.
* **Response strategy**: The plan or approach for handling a timeout, which may involve retrying the action, canceling it, or notifying the user.
* **Recovery process**: The process of returning the system to a stable state after a timeout, which is essential for maintaining system reliability and preventing data corruption.
* **Retry policy**: A set of rules that govern when and how to retry a timed-out action, which helps to balance the need for reliability with the risk of overwhelming the system with repeated attempts.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Handling Timed Out Actions involves the following components:
1. **Timeout detection mechanism**: A component that monitors the elapsed time of an action and triggers a timeout event when the specified time limit is exceeded.
2. **Response strategy module**: A component that determines the course of action to take when a timeout occurs, based on a predefined response strategy.
3. **Recovery process module**: A component that ensures the system returns to a stable state after a timeout, by rolling back transactions, releasing resources, or updating system state.
4. **Retry policy module**: A component that governs when and how to retry a timed-out action, based on a predefined retry policy.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Handling Timed Out Actions include:
* **Retry with exponential backoff**: Retrying a timed-out action with increasing delays between attempts, to avoid overwhelming the system with repeated attempts.
* **Cancel and notify**: Canceling a timed-out action and notifying the user, to prevent further attempts and inform the user of the failure.
* **Timeout escalation**: Escalating a timeout to a higher-level error handling mechanism, to ensure that the system can recover from the failure.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Handling Timed Out Actions include:
* **Infinite retry**: Retrying a timed-out action indefinitely, without a limit on the number of attempts or a backoff strategy, which can lead to system overload and decreased reliability.
* **Ignoring timeouts**: Ignoring timeouts and allowing the system to continue operating in an unstable state, which can lead to data corruption and system crashes.
* **Using a fixed timeout value**: Using a fixed timeout value without considering the specific requirements of the action or the system, which can lead to premature timeouts or timeouts that are too long.
