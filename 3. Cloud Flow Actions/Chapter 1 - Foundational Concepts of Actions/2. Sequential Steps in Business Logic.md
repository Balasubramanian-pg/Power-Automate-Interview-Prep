## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 2. Sequential Steps in Business Logic exists and the class of problems it addresses. Sequential steps in business logic are essential for managing complex workflows, ensuring data integrity, and maintaining consistency across various systems and applications. The primary purpose of sequential steps is to break down intricate business processes into manageable, ordered tasks that can be executed in a specific sequence to achieve a desired outcome. This approach addresses the problems of process complexity, data inconsistency, and system integration by providing a structured framework for designing, implementing, and executing business logic.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic. Sequential steps in business logic can be visualized as a series of interconnected nodes or tasks, each representing a specific action or decision point. These nodes are arranged in a particular order, with each node building upon the output or result of the preceding node. This linear progression enables the creation of complex workflows that can adapt to various inputs, conditions, and exceptions, ultimately producing a predictable and consistent output.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Business Logic | The underlying rules, processes, and algorithms that govern the behavior of a system or application. |
| Sequential Step | A single, discrete task or action within a business process that is executed in a specific order. |
| Workflow | A series of sequential steps or tasks that are coordinated to achieve a specific business objective. |
| Decision Point | A node or step within a workflow that requires a decision or evaluation to determine the next course of action. |
| Exception Handling | The process of managing and resolving unexpected errors or exceptions that occur during the execution of a workflow. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic. The core concepts of sequential steps in business logic include:
* **Linearity**: The sequential execution of tasks in a specific order.
* **Conditionality**: The use of decision points to determine the next course of action based on specific conditions or inputs.
* **Iteration**: The repetition of tasks or steps to achieve a specific outcome or until a certain condition is met.
* **Exception Handling**: The ability to detect, manage, and resolve exceptions or errors that occur during workflow execution.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model. The standard model for sequential steps in business logic typically involves the following components:
* **Input**: The initial data or trigger that initiates the workflow.
* **Sequential Steps**: A series of tasks or actions that are executed in a specific order.
* **Decision Points**: Nodes or steps that require a decision or evaluation to determine the next course of action.
* **Output**: The final result or outcome of the workflow.
* **Exception Handling**: Mechanisms for detecting, managing, and resolving exceptions or errors that occur during workflow execution.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns. Common patterns in sequential steps in business logic include:
* **Validation**: Verifying input data or workflow state to ensure correctness and consistency.
* **Transformation**: Converting or manipulating data to prepare it for subsequent steps or actions.
* **Decision Tables**: Using tables or matrices to define decision logic and determine the next course of action.
* **Error Handling**: Implementing mechanisms to detect, manage, and resolve exceptions or errors that occur during workflow execution.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices. Anti-patterns in sequential steps in business logic include:
* **Tight Coupling**: Overly rigid or inflexible workflows that are difficult to maintain or modify.
* **Complex Conditionals**: Overly complex decision logic that is difficult to understand or maintain.
* **Unmanaged Exceptions**: Failing to implement adequate exception handling mechanisms, leading to workflow failures or errors.
* **Inconsistent Data**: Failing to ensure data consistency or integrity throughout the workflow.
