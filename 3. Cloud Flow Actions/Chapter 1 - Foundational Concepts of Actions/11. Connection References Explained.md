# 11. Connection References Explained

Canonical documentation for 11. Connection References Explained. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 11. Connection References Explained exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Connection References Explained is to provide a comprehensive understanding of connection references, which are essential in establishing and managing connections between systems, applications, or services. The problem space addressed by this topic includes the complexities of connection management, such as handling multiple connections, ensuring connection security, and optimizing connection performance. Connection References Explained aims to provide a unified framework for understanding and working with connection references, thereby simplifying the development and maintenance of connected systems.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Connection references can be thought of as a mapping between a connection identifier and the underlying connection details, such as the connection protocol, endpoint, and authentication credentials. This mapping enables systems to establish, manage, and utilize connections without exposing sensitive connection information. The conceptual overview of Connection References Explained involves understanding the key components of connection references, including connection identifiers, connection details, and the mapping between them.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Connection Reference | A mapping between a connection identifier and the underlying connection details. |
| Connection Identifier | A unique identifier for a connection, used to reference the connection without exposing sensitive connection information. |
| Connection Details | The underlying details of a connection, including the connection protocol, endpoint, and authentication credentials. |
| Connection Protocol | The protocol used to establish and manage a connection, such as TCP/IP or HTTP. |
| Endpoint | The destination or target of a connection, such as a server or a service. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Connection References Explained include:
* **Connection Abstraction**: The idea of abstracting connection details behind a connection identifier, enabling systems to work with connections without exposing sensitive information.
* **Connection Mapping**: The process of mapping connection identifiers to underlying connection details, enabling systems to establish and manage connections.
* **Connection Management**: The process of creating, updating, and deleting connection references, as well as managing connection details and protocols.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Connection References Explained involves a layered architecture, consisting of:
* **Connection Reference Layer**: Responsible for managing connection references and providing a unified interface for working with connections.
* **Connection Protocol Layer**: Responsible for implementing connection protocols and managing connection details.
* **Endpoint Layer**: Responsible for interacting with endpoints and managing endpoint-specific details.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Connection References Explained include:
* **Connection Pooling**: The practice of reusing existing connections to improve performance and reduce overhead.
* **Connection Caching**: The practice of caching connection details to improve performance and reduce the overhead of connection establishment.
* **Connection Validation**: The practice of validating connection details and protocols to ensure connection security and integrity.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Connection References Explained include:
* **Hardcoding Connection Details**: The practice of hardcoding connection details, such as endpoints or authentication credentials, which can lead to security vulnerabilities and maintenance issues.
* **Exposing Sensitive Connection Information**: The practice of exposing sensitive connection information, such as authentication credentials or encryption keys, which can lead to security breaches and data compromise.
* **Ignoring Connection Management**: The practice of ignoring connection management, which can lead to connection leaks, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities.
