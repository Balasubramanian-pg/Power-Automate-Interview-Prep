# 18. Handling Skipped Actions

Canonical documentation for 18. Handling Skipped Actions. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 18. Handling Skipped Actions exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of handling skipped actions is to provide a robust and reliable mechanism for managing actions that are not executed as expected. This can occur due to various reasons such as errors, exceptions, or changes in the underlying system. The problem space includes scenarios where actions are skipped, and the system needs to recover, retry, or compensate for the skipped actions.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Handling skipped actions involves a conceptual framework that includes action tracking, error detection, and recovery mechanisms. The framework consists of three primary components: action registration, action execution, and action recovery. Action registration involves recording the actions to be executed, while action execution involves the actual execution of the actions. Action recovery involves detecting and handling skipped actions, which can include retrying, compensating, or logging the skipped actions.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Action | A discrete unit of work that is executed as part of a larger process |
| Skipped Action | An action that is not executed as expected due to errors, exceptions, or changes in the underlying system |
| Action Registration | The process of recording actions to be executed |
| Action Execution | The actual execution of the actions |
| Action Recovery | The process of detecting and handling skipped actions |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of handling skipped actions include action tracking, error detection, and recovery mechanisms. Action tracking involves recording the actions to be executed and monitoring their execution. Error detection involves identifying errors or exceptions that occur during action execution. Recovery mechanisms involve retrying, compensating, or logging skipped actions to ensure system reliability and consistency.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for handling skipped actions involves a three-step process: action registration, action execution, and action recovery. Action registration involves recording the actions to be executed, while action execution involves the actual execution of the actions. Action recovery involves detecting and handling skipped actions, which can include retrying, compensating, or logging the skipped actions.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for handling skipped actions include:
* Retry pattern: retrying the skipped action after a specified time interval
* Compensation pattern: executing a compensating action to undo the effects of the skipped action
* Logging pattern: logging the skipped action for auditing and debugging purposes

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for handling skipped actions include:
* Ignoring skipped actions: ignoring skipped actions can lead to system inconsistencies and errors
* Over-retrying: retrying skipped actions excessively can lead to system overload and decreased performance
* Under-logging: inadequate logging of skipped actions can make it difficult to diagnose and debug system issues
