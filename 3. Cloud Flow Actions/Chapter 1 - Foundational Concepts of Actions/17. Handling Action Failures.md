# 17. Handling Action Failures

Canonical documentation for 17. Handling Action Failures. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 17. Handling Action Failures exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Handling action failures is a critical aspect of designing and implementing robust systems. It exists to address the class of problems that arise when actions, such as API calls, database transactions, or file operations, fail to complete successfully. The purpose of handling action failures is to provide a mechanism for detecting, reporting, and recovering from failures, ensuring that the system remains in a consistent state and minimizes the impact on users.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of handling action failures involves a feedback loop that consists of three primary components: failure detection, error reporting, and recovery. Failure detection involves identifying when an action has failed, error reporting involves notifying the system and users of the failure, and recovery involves taking corrective action to restore the system to a consistent state.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Action | A discrete unit of work, such as an API call or database transaction, that can fail or succeed. |
| Failure | An action that does not complete successfully, resulting in an error or exception. |
| Error | A condition that occurs when an action fails, often accompanied by an error message or code. |
| Exception | A runtime error that occurs when an action fails, often used to handle and recover from failures. |
| Retry | The act of re-executing a failed action in an attempt to succeed. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of handling action failures include:
* **Failure detection**: Identifying when an action has failed, often using try-catch blocks, error codes, or logging mechanisms.
* **Error reporting**: Notifying the system and users of the failure, often using logging, alerting, or notification mechanisms.
* **Recovery**: Taking corrective action to restore the system to a consistent state, often using retry mechanisms, rollback procedures, or compensation actions.
* **Idempotence**: Designing actions to be idempotent, meaning that they can be safely retried without causing unintended side effects.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for handling action failures involves a combination of failure detection, error reporting, and recovery mechanisms. This model typically includes:
* **Try-catch blocks**: Using try-catch blocks to detect and handle failures at the code level.
* **Error handling frameworks**: Using error handling frameworks, such as exception handling or error codes, to handle and report failures.
* **Retry mechanisms**: Implementing retry mechanisms, such as exponential backoff or circuit breakers, to recover from failures.
* **Logging and monitoring**: Using logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and report failures.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for handling action failures include:
* **Retry pattern**: Retrying a failed action a fixed number of times before giving up.
* **Circuit breaker pattern**: Detecting when a service is not responding and preventing further requests until it becomes available again.
* **Fallback pattern**: Providing a fallback or default value when an action fails.
* **Compensation pattern**: Implementing a compensation action to undo the effects of a failed action.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for handling action failures include:
* **Ignoring failures**: Failing to detect or report failures, leading to silent failures and inconsistent system state.
* **Over-retrying**: Retrying a failed action too many times, leading to resource exhaustion and decreased system performance.
* **Not implementing idempotence**: Failing to design actions to be idempotent, leading to unintended side effects when retrying failed actions.
