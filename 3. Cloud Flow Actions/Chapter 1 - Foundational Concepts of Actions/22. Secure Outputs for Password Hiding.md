# 22. Secure Outputs for Password Hiding

Canonical documentation for 22. Secure Outputs for Password Hiding. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 22. Secure Outputs for Password Hiding exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of Secure Outputs for Password Hiding is to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information, specifically passwords, by ensuring that they are not inadvertently exposed through output mechanisms such as logs, debug messages, or user interfaces. This addresses the problem of password leakage, which can occur due to inadequate security measures, poor coding practices, or insufficient testing.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Secure Outputs for Password Hiding involves a set of principles, guidelines, and techniques aimed at protecting passwords from being exposed through various output channels. This includes masking or redacting passwords in logs, using secure protocols for data transmission, and implementing robust access controls to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Password Hiding | The practice of concealing passwords from unauthorized access or exposure. |
| Secure Output | An output mechanism that protects sensitive information, such as passwords, from being exposed. |
| Password Masking | The process of replacing password characters with a masking character, such as an asterisk (\*), to prevent exposure. |
| Redaction | The process of removing or obscuring sensitive information, including passwords, from output. |
| Access Control | The process of granting or denying access to sensitive information based on user identity, role, or permissions. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Secure Outputs for Password Hiding include:
* Password protection: ensuring that passwords are not exposed through output mechanisms.
* Access control: restricting access to sensitive information based on user identity, role, or permissions.
* Data encryption: protecting data in transit or at rest using encryption protocols.
* Secure coding practices: following best practices for secure coding, such as input validation and error handling.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Secure Outputs for Password Hiding involves a multi-layered approach, including:
* Password masking or redaction in logs and user interfaces.
* Implementing access controls, such as authentication and authorization.
* Using secure protocols for data transmission, such as HTTPS or SFTP.
* Regularly reviewing and updating security policies and procedures.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Secure Outputs for Password Hiding include:
* Using password masking or redaction in logs and user interfaces.
* Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive information.
* Using secure protocols for data transmission, such as HTTPS or SFTP.
* Regularly reviewing and updating security policies and procedures.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Secure Outputs for Password Hiding include:
* Hardcoding passwords in code or configuration files.
* Using insecure protocols for data transmission, such as HTTP or FTP.
* Failing to implement access controls, such as authentication and authorization.
* Neglecting to regularly review and update security policies and procedures.
