# 25. Pinpointing Data Type Issues

Canonical documentation for 25. Pinpointing Data Type Issues. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 25. Pinpointing Data Type Issues exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Pinpointing Data Type Issues exists to help developers and data analysts identify and resolve data type inconsistencies and errors that can lead to incorrect results, system crashes, or security vulnerabilities. The class of problems it addresses includes data type mismatches, invalid data, and inconsistent data formatting, which can occur in various data processing and storage systems, such as databases, data warehouses, and file systems.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of Pinpointing Data Type Issues involves understanding the data type hierarchy, data type conversion rules, and data validation techniques. It requires a mental model of how data types are defined, how they are used in different contexts, and how they can be transformed or converted from one type to another. This mental model should also include an understanding of the common data type issues that can arise, such as type mismatches, overflow errors, and formatting inconsistencies.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Data Type | A category of data that defines its format, size, and set of values it can hold |
| Type Mismatch | A condition where a value is assigned to a variable or used in an operation that expects a different data type |
| Data Validation | The process of checking data for correctness, completeness, and consistency |
| Type Conversion | The process of changing the data type of a value from one type to another |
| Data Normalization | The process of transforming data into a standard format to improve data quality and consistency |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Pinpointing Data Type Issues include understanding the data type hierarchy, data type conversion rules, and data validation techniques. It also involves understanding the common data type issues that can arise, such as type mismatches, overflow errors, and formatting inconsistencies. Additionally, it requires knowledge of data normalization techniques, data quality metrics, and data governance principles.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Pinpointing Data Type Issues involves a combination of data validation, data normalization, and data type conversion techniques. It includes the following steps:
1. Data profiling: analyzing data to identify its structure, content, and quality
2. Data validation: checking data for correctness, completeness, and consistency
3. Data normalization: transforming data into a standard format to improve data quality and consistency
4. Data type conversion: changing the data type of a value from one type to another
5. Data quality metrics: measuring data quality using metrics such as accuracy, completeness, and consistency

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Pinpointing Data Type Issues include:
* Using data validation rules to check data for correctness and consistency
* Implementing data normalization techniques to transform data into a standard format
* Using data type conversion functions to change the data type of a value
* Monitoring data quality metrics to identify areas for improvement
* Using data governance principles to ensure data quality and consistency

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Common anti-patterns for Pinpointing Data Type Issues include:
* Ignoring data validation rules and relying on default values or assumptions
* Using inadequate or incomplete data normalization techniques
* Failing to monitor data quality metrics and address data quality issues
* Using data type conversion functions without proper validation or error handling
* Neglecting data governance principles and allowing data quality to degrade over time
