Canonical documentation for 8. How Outputs Feed Subsequent Actions. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 8. How Outputs Feed Subsequent Actions exists and the class of problems it addresses. The primary purpose of understanding how outputs feed subsequent actions is to facilitate the design of efficient, sequential workflows. This knowledge helps in addressing the class of problems related to process optimization, where the output of one task or process serves as the input for another, thereby creating a chain of dependent actions. By comprehending this relationship, individuals can better manage complex workflows, reduce bottlenecks, and enhance overall productivity.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic. The conceptual model of how outputs feed subsequent actions can be visualized as a series of interconnected nodes, where each node represents a task or process. The output of each node is directed towards another node, signifying the flow of information or resources from one task to the next. This model emphasizes the sequential or sometimes parallel nature of tasks, highlighting the dependency between different stages of a workflow.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Output | The result or product of a process or task, which can be in the form of data, physical goods, or services. |
| Subsequent Action | A task or process that follows another, often dependent on the output of the preceding task for its initiation or execution. |
| Workflow | A series of tasks or processes that are interconnected to achieve a specific goal or set of goals. |
| Dependency | A relationship between tasks where the initiation or completion of one task is contingent upon the output or completion of another. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic. The core concepts include understanding the nature of outputs as they relate to subsequent actions, recognizing the types of dependencies between tasks (such as finish-to-start, start-to-start, etc.), and being able to map out workflows to identify critical paths and potential bottlenecks. Additionally, the concept of feedback loops, where the output of a later process affects an earlier one, is crucial for managing complex systems.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model. The standard model for understanding how outputs feed subsequent actions involves a structured approach to workflow design, including the identification of all tasks, the determination of dependencies between these tasks, and the allocation of resources. This model also incorporates the concept of continuous improvement, where workflows are periodically reviewed and optimized to reflect changing conditions or new efficiencies.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns. Common patterns include the use of Gantt charts or similar visual tools to map out workflows and dependencies, the implementation of just-in-time (JIT) production to minimize inventory and maximize efficiency, and the adoption of agile methodologies to facilitate flexibility and rapid response to change. Another pattern is the use of business process modeling notation (BPMN) to standardize the representation of workflows.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices. Anti-patterns in this context include the failure to map out workflows and dependencies formally, leading to inefficiencies and misunderstandings, the over-reliance on manual processes that could be automated, and the lack of continuous review and optimization of workflows. Another anti-pattern is the neglect of feedback mechanisms, which can lead to the persistence of errors or inefficiencies within a workflow.
