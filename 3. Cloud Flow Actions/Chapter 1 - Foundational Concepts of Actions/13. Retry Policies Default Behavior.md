# 13. Retry Policies Default Behavior

Canonical documentation for 13. Retry Policies Default Behavior. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 13. Retry Policies Default Behavior exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Retry Policies Default Behavior exists to provide a standardized approach to handling transient failures in distributed systems, allowing for more robust and resilient applications. It addresses the class of problems related to network partitions, server crashes, and other temporary errors that can cause service unavailability.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Retry Policies Default Behavior is based on the concept of exponential backoff, where the system waits for an increasing amount of time between retries to avoid overwhelming the failed service. This approach helps to prevent cascading failures and allows the system to recover more quickly from transient errors.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Retry Policy | A set of rules that define when and how to retry a failed operation |
| Exponential Backoff | A strategy for increasing the time between retries to avoid overwhelming a failed service |
| Transient Failure | A temporary error that can be recovered from by retrying the operation |
| Retry Count | The number of times a failed operation is retried before considering it a permanent failure |
| Backoff Factor | The multiplier used to increase the time between retries |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Retry Policies Default Behavior include:
* **Idempotence**: The ability of an operation to be safely retried without causing unintended side effects
* **Transient failure detection**: The ability to detect and distinguish between transient and permanent failures
* **Exponential backoff**: The strategy for increasing the time between retries to avoid overwhelming a failed service
* **Retry count limits**: The maximum number of times a failed operation is retried before considering it a permanent failure

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Retry Policies Default Behavior involves:
1. Detecting a transient failure
2. Initiating a retry with an initial backoff delay
3. Exponentially increasing the backoff delay between retries
4. Limiting the number of retries to prevent infinite loops
5. Considering a failure permanent after exceeding the retry count limit

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for implementing Retry Policies Default Behavior include:
* **Linear backoff**: Increasing the backoff delay by a fixed amount between retries
* **Randomized backoff**: Adding a random jitter to the backoff delay to prevent synchronized retries
* **Circuit breakers**: Detecting when a service is not responding and preventing further requests until it recovers

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for implementing Retry Policies Default Behavior include:
* **Infinite retries**: Retrying a failed operation indefinitely without a limit
* **No backoff**: Retrying a failed operation immediately without any delay
* **No transient failure detection**: Treating all failures as permanent and not retrying
