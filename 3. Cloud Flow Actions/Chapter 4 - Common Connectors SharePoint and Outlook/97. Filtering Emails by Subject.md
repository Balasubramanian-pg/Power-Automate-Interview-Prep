> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 97. Filtering Emails by Subject exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of filtering emails by subject is to automatically organize, prioritize, or redirect emails based on their subject lines, thereby improving email management efficiency and reducing information overload. This functionality addresses the problem of manual email sorting, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially in high-volume email environments.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Filtering emails by subject involves creating rules or filters that specify actions to be taken when an email's subject matches certain criteria. These criteria can include exact phrases, keywords, or patterns. The actions can range from moving the email to a specific folder, marking it as read or important, to forwarding it to another email address or deleting it.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Filter | A set of criteria and actions applied to emails to manage their flow and organization. |
| Subject Line | The line of text that appears at the top of an email message, summarizing its content. |
| Keyword Filtering | The process of filtering emails based on the presence of specific words or phrases in the subject line. |
| Pattern Matching | The use of wildcards or regular expressions to match subject lines against more complex patterns. |
| Action | The operation performed on an email when its subject matches a filter's criteria, such as moving, copying, or deleting. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of filtering emails by subject include:
- **Specification**: Clearly defining what constitutes a match (e.g., exact phrase, keyword, pattern).
- **Action**: Determining what happens to the email once it matches the filter criteria.
- **Scope**: Identifying which emails are eligible for filtering (e.g., all incoming emails, emails from specific senders).
- **Priority**: In cases where multiple filters apply, determining the order in which they are applied.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for filtering emails by subject typically involves:
1. **Setup**: Creating a new filter by specifying the criteria (subject line content) and the desired action.
2. **Application**: The email client or server applies the filter to incoming or existing emails.
3. **Review**: Periodically reviewing and updating filters to ensure they remain relevant and effective.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns include:
- **Auto-archiving**: Automatically moving emails with specific subjects to archive folders.
- **Priority Flagging**: Marking emails with certain keywords in the subject as high priority.
- **Auto-deletion**: Automatically deleting spam or junk emails based on subject line patterns.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns include:
- **Overly Broad Filters**: Creating filters that are too general, potentially catching and mismanaging legitimate emails.
- **Insufficient Review**: Failing to regularly review and update filters, leading to decreased effectiveness over time.
- **Lack of Testing**: Not testing filters before applying them to live email flows, which can result in unexpected behavior.
