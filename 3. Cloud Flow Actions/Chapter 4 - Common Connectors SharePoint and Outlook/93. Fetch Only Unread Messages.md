Canonical documentation for 93. Fetch Only Unread Messages. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 93. Fetch Only Unread Messages exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of fetching only unread messages is to optimize data retrieval and processing by reducing the amount of data transferred and processed, thereby improving system performance and efficiency. This approach addresses the problem of unnecessary data transfer and processing, which can lead to increased latency, bandwidth consumption, and resource utilization. By fetching only unread messages, systems can minimize the overhead associated with handling large volumes of data, resulting in a better user experience and improved overall system reliability.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of fetching only unread messages involves a messaging system that maintains a state of message readability, where each message is marked as either read or unread. The system provides an interface for clients to fetch messages, and the client can specify whether to retrieve all messages or only those that are unread. The system then filters the messages based on the client's request and returns only the unread messages, thereby reducing the amount of data transferred and processed.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Unread Message | A message that has not been marked as read by the recipient. |
| Read Message | A message that has been marked as read by the recipient. |
| Messaging System | A system that enables the exchange of messages between clients, such as email or instant messaging. |
| Client | An application or system that interacts with the messaging system to send and receive messages. |
| Message Filtering | The process of selecting a subset of messages based on specific criteria, such as readability. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of fetching only unread messages include message state management, message filtering, and data optimization. Message state management involves maintaining the readability state of each message, while message filtering enables the selection of a subset of messages based on specific criteria. Data optimization is achieved by reducing the amount of data transferred and processed, resulting in improved system performance and efficiency.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for fetching only unread messages involves a request-response protocol, where the client sends a request to the messaging system to fetch unread messages. The messaging system then filters the messages based on the client's request and returns only the unread messages. The client can then process the unread messages and mark them as read, updating the message state in the messaging system.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for fetching only unread messages include polling, where the client periodically sends requests to the messaging system to fetch unread messages, and push notifications, where the messaging system notifies the client of new unread messages. Another pattern is the use of message queues, where the client retrieves unread messages from a queue, processing them in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) order.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for fetching only unread messages include fetching all messages and then filtering them on the client-side, which can result in unnecessary data transfer and processing. Another anti-pattern is the use of a single request to fetch all messages, without providing an option to filter by readability, which can lead to increased latency and resource utilization.
