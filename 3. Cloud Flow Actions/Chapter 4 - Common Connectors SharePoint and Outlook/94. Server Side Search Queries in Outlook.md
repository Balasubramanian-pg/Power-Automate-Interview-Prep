> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 94. Server Side Search Queries in Outlook exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Server Side Search Queries in Outlook is to provide an efficient and scalable method for searching and retrieving data from Microsoft Exchange servers. This feature addresses the problem of slow and resource-intensive search queries, which can impact user productivity and overall system performance. By offloading search queries to the server, Outlook can improve search performance, reduce the load on client devices, and enhance the overall user experience.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Server Side Search Queries in Outlook utilize a client-server architecture, where the Outlook client sends search requests to the Exchange server, which then processes the query and returns the relevant results. This approach enables Outlook to leverage the processing power and resources of the server, rather than relying on the client device. The server-side search functionality is built on top of the Exchange Search engine, which provides a robust and scalable search platform.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Server Side Search | A search query that is executed on the server, rather than the client device. |
| Exchange Search Engine | A robust search platform that provides indexing, querying, and retrieval of data from Exchange servers. |
| Query Builder | A component that constructs and optimizes search queries for execution on the server. |
| Search Result | A set of items that match the search criteria, returned by the server in response to a search query. |
| Indexing | The process of creating and maintaining a database of searchable metadata, used to accelerate search queries. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Server Side Search Queries in Outlook include:
* **Indexing**: The process of creating and maintaining a database of searchable metadata, used to accelerate search queries.
* **Query Optimization**: The process of analyzing and optimizing search queries to improve performance and reduce resource utilization.
* **Search Result Ranking**: The process of ranking search results based on relevance, to provide the most accurate and useful results to the user.
* **Server-Side Processing**: The execution of search queries on the server, rather than the client device, to improve performance and reduce resource utilization.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Server Side Search Queries in Outlook involves the following components and processes:
* **Outlook Client**: The client application that sends search requests to the Exchange server.
* **Exchange Server**: The server that processes search queries and returns results to the Outlook client.
* **Query Builder**: A component that constructs and optimizes search queries for execution on the server.
* **Search Engine**: The Exchange Search engine, which provides indexing, querying, and retrieval of data from Exchange servers.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Server Side Search Queries in Outlook include:
* **Simple Search**: A basic search query that retrieves a list of items matching a specific keyword or phrase.
* **Advanced Search**: A search query that uses multiple criteria, such as keywords, dates, and sender/recipients, to retrieve a more specific set of results.
* **Search Folders**: A feature that allows users to create and manage virtual folders based on search queries, providing a convenient way to access and organize search results.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Server Side Search Queries in Outlook include:
* **Client-Side Search**: Executing search queries on the client device, rather than the server, which can lead to slow performance and increased resource utilization.
* **Unoptimized Queries**: Failing to optimize search queries, which can result in poor performance, increased resource utilization, and reduced search accuracy.
* **Insufficient Indexing**: Failing to maintain adequate indexing, which can lead to slow search performance and reduced search accuracy.
