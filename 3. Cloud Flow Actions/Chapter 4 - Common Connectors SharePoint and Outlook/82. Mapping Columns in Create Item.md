# 82. Mapping Columns in Create Item

Canonical documentation for 82. Mapping Columns in Create Item. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 82. Mapping Columns in Create Item exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of mapping columns in create item is to establish a relationship between the source data and the target data structure, enabling efficient and accurate data transfer. This process addresses the problem of data inconsistency, redundancy, and integrity issues that arise when data is created or updated without proper column mapping. By mapping columns effectively, users can ensure that data is properly aligned, validated, and transformed, resulting in improved data quality and reduced errors.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of mapping columns in create item involves understanding the source and target data structures, identifying the corresponding columns, and defining the mapping rules. This process requires a deep understanding of the data models, data types, and business rules that govern the data. The mapping process can be simple or complex, depending on the number of columns, data types, and transformation requirements. A well-designed column mapping strategy ensures that data is accurately transferred, validated, and transformed, resulting in a robust and reliable data integration process.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Column Mapping | The process of establishing a relationship between the source and target data columns. |
| Source Column | The column in the source data structure that contains the data to be transferred. |
| Target Column | The column in the target data structure that receives the transferred data. |
| Mapping Rule | A set of instructions that defines how the source data is transformed and validated before being transferred to the target column. |
| Data Transformation | The process of converting the source data into a format that is compatible with the target column. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of mapping columns in create item include:
* Column correspondence: identifying the matching columns between the source and target data structures.
* Data type compatibility: ensuring that the data types of the source and target columns are compatible.
* Mapping rules: defining the rules that govern the data transformation and validation process.
* Data validation: verifying that the transferred data meets the required business rules and data quality standards.
* Error handling: managing errors that occur during the data transfer process, such as data type mismatches or validation failures.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for mapping columns in create item involves the following steps:
1. Identify the source and target data structures.
2. Determine the corresponding columns between the source and target data structures.
3. Define the mapping rules, including data transformation and validation requirements.
4. Implement the column mapping using a data integration tool or programming language.
5. Test and validate the column mapping to ensure data accuracy and quality.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in mapping columns in create item include:
* One-to-one mapping: mapping a single source column to a single target column.
* One-to-many mapping: mapping a single source column to multiple target columns.
* Many-to-one mapping: mapping multiple source columns to a single target column.
* Data type conversion: converting the data type of the source column to match the target column.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in mapping columns in create item include:
* Hardcoding column mappings: using hardcoded values or magic numbers to define column mappings.
* Ignoring data validation: failing to validate the transferred data, resulting in data quality issues.
* Using inadequate data transformation: using incomplete or incorrect data transformation rules, resulting in data inconsistencies.
