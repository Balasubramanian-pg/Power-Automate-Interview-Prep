> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 88. Configuring To Cc and Bcc exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of configuring To, Cc, and Bcc is to manage email recipients effectively, ensuring that messages are delivered to the intended parties while maintaining transparency and organization. This configuration addresses the problem of inefficient email communication, where important messages may be overlooked or sent to incorrect recipients.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Configuring To, Cc, and Bcc involves understanding the roles of each field in an email. The "To" field is for primary recipients, the "Cc" (carbon copy) field is for secondary recipients who should be informed but are not required to take action, and the "Bcc" (blind carbon copy) field is for recipients who should receive the email without their addresses being visible to others.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| To | The primary recipient(s) of an email, who are expected to take action or respond. |
| Cc | Secondary recipient(s) of an email, who are kept informed but not expected to take action. |
| Bcc | Recipient(s) of an email whose addresses are not visible to other recipients. |
| Email Client | Software or application used to manage and send emails. |
| Email Protocol | Standards governing email communication, such as SMTP, IMAP, and POP3. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts include understanding the differences between To, Cc, and Bcc, knowing when to use each field appropriately, and being aware of email protocols and client settings that may affect how these fields are handled.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for configuring To, Cc, and Bcc involves using the To field for direct communication, the Cc field for informational purposes, and the Bcc field for privacy or to prevent recipient lists from being exposed. This model emphasizes clarity and respect for recipients' time and privacy.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns include using Cc for sending emails to groups where not all members need to respond, using Bcc for sending emails to large lists to protect recipient privacy, and using To for direct, personalized communication.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns include overusing the Cc field, which can lead to information overload for secondary recipients, and misusing the Bcc field, such as sending spam or inappropriate content without accountability.
