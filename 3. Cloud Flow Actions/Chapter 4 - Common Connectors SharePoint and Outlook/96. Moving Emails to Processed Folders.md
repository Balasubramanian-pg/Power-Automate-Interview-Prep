## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 96. Moving Emails to Processed Folders exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of moving emails to processed folders is to maintain a clean and organized inbox, reducing clutter and making it easier to find important emails. This process addresses the problem of email overload, where a large number of emails can become overwhelming, making it difficult to prioritize and manage tasks. By moving processed emails to designated folders, users can free up space in their inbox, reduce stress, and improve productivity.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of moving emails to processed folders involves a simple, yet effective workflow. Emails are received in the inbox, where they are reviewed and acted upon. Once an email has been processed, it is moved to a designated folder, such as "Completed" or "Archived". This folder serves as a repository for emails that no longer require attention, allowing the user to focus on new, incoming emails.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Inbox | The primary folder where new emails are received |
| Processed Folder | A designated folder where emails are moved after being reviewed and acted upon |
| Email Client | A software application used to manage and organize emails |
| Folder Hierarchy | A system of organized folders and subfolders used to categorize and store emails |
| Archiving | The process of moving emails to a long-term storage folder, often for record-keeping or compliance purposes |
