> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 77. Filtering Data on the Server Side exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of filtering data on the server side is to reduce the amount of data transmitted over the network, improve application performance, and enhance data security. This approach addresses the problem of handling large datasets, reducing bandwidth consumption, and protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access. By filtering data on the server side, applications can provide users with relevant information while minimizing the risk of data exposure and improving overall system efficiency.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Filtering data on the server side involves a multi-step process that includes data retrieval, filtering criteria application, and result set generation. The process typically begins with a request from the client, which is then processed by the server. The server retrieves the relevant data from the database or storage system and applies the specified filtering criteria to produce a subset of the original data. The filtered data is then transmitted to the client, which can further process or display the results as needed.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Server-side filtering | The process of filtering data on the server before transmitting it to the client. |
| Client-side filtering | The process of filtering data on the client after receiving it from the server. |
| Data retrieval | The process of fetching data from a database or storage system. |
| Filtering criteria | The conditions or rules used to filter data, such as search queries or data ranges. |
| Result set | The subset of data produced by applying the filtering criteria to the original data. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of server-side filtering include data retrieval, filtering criteria application, and result set generation. Data retrieval involves fetching the relevant data from the database or storage system, while filtering criteria application involves using conditions or rules to narrow down the data. Result set generation involves producing a subset of the original data based on the applied filtering criteria. Additionally, concepts such as data indexing, caching, and pagination can be used to optimize server-side filtering and improve application performance.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for server-side filtering typically involves the following components:
1. Data storage: A database or storage system that holds the original data.
2. Server-side application: A server-side application that retrieves data from the storage system and applies filtering criteria.
3. Filtering engine: A component that applies the filtering criteria to the retrieved data and produces a result set.
4. Result set generator: A component that generates the final result set based on the filtered data.
5. Client-side application: A client-side application that receives the filtered data and displays or further processes it as needed.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for server-side filtering include:
1. Using query parameters to specify filtering criteria.
2. Implementing data pagination to limit the amount of data transmitted.
3. Using caching to store frequently accessed data and reduce database queries.
4. Applying data indexing to improve data retrieval performance.
5. Using secure protocols to protect sensitive data during transmission.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for server-side filtering include:
1. Retrieving entire datasets and filtering on the client side, resulting in unnecessary data transmission and potential security risks.
2. Using insecure protocols to transmit sensitive data, exposing it to unauthorized access.
3. Failing to implement proper data indexing, resulting in poor data retrieval performance.
4. Not using caching or pagination, leading to increased server load and decreased application performance.
5. Applying filtering criteria on the client side, which can lead to inconsistent results and decreased security.
