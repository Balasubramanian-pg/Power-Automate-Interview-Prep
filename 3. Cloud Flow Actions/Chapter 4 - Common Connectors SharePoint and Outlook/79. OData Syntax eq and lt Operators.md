# 79. OData Syntax eq and lt Operators

Canonical documentation for 79. OData Syntax eq and lt Operators. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
The OData syntax eq and lt operators exist to address the need for filtering and querying data in a standardized and efficient manner. These operators are part of the OData protocol, which is a widely adopted standard for building and consuming RESTful APIs. The eq (equal) and lt (less than) operators are used to filter data based on specific conditions, allowing clients to retrieve only the relevant data from a server. This is particularly useful in scenarios where large amounts of data are involved, and filtering at the server-side can significantly reduce the amount of data transferred over the network.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
The OData syntax eq and lt operators are used in the $filter system query option to specify conditions that must be met for a record to be included in the result set. The eq operator is used to test for equality between a property and a value, while the lt operator is used to test if a property is less than a specified value. These operators can be combined using logical operators such as and, or, and not to create more complex filter expressions.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| eq | The equal operator, used to test for equality between a property and a value. |
| lt | The less than operator, used to test if a property is less than a specified value. |
| $filter | A system query option used to specify a filter expression that must be met for a record to be included in the result set. |
| OData | The Open Data Protocol, a standardized protocol for building and consuming RESTful APIs. |

## 4. Core Concepts
The core concepts of the OData syntax eq and lt operators include:
* Using the eq operator to filter data based on equality conditions
* Using the lt operator to filter data based on less than conditions
* Combining eq and lt operators using logical operators to create complex filter expressions
* Using the $filter system query option to specify filter expressions

## 5. Standard Model
The standard model for using the OData syntax eq and lt operators involves the following steps:
1. Identify the property to be filtered
2. Determine the condition to be applied (equality or less than)
3. Construct the filter expression using the eq or lt operator
4. Combine the filter expression with other conditions using logical operators if necessary
5. Apply the $filter system query option to the request URL

## 6. Common Patterns
Common patterns for using the OData syntax eq and lt operators include:
* Filtering data based on a specific value: `https://example.com/Customers?$filter=Country eq 'USA'`
* Filtering data based on a range of values: `https://example.com/Orders?$filter=Total gt 100 and Total lt 1000`
* Combining multiple conditions: `https://example.com/Products?$filter=Category eq 'Electronics' and Price lt 100`

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Anti-patterns to avoid when using the OData syntax eq and lt operators include:
* Using the eq operator with a range of values: `https://example.com/Orders?$filter=Total eq 100 and Total eq 200` (instead, use the gt and lt operators)
* Using the lt operator with a single value: `https://example.com/Products?$filter=Price lt 100 and Price eq 50` (instead, use the eq operator for the single value)
