Canonical documentation for 86. Partial Updates in SharePoint. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 86. Partial Updates in SharePoint exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Partial Updates in SharePoint exist to address the need for efficient and targeted updates to SharePoint lists and libraries, reducing the overhead and improving performance by only updating the changed fields rather than the entire item. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where large amounts of data are being updated, and a full update would be resource-intensive.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of Partial Updates in SharePoint revolves around the idea of updating specific fields or properties of a list item or document without affecting the entire item. This is achieved through the use of specialized APIs and protocols that allow for targeted updates, ensuring that only the necessary data is transmitted and processed.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Partial Update | An update that modifies only specific fields or properties of a SharePoint item, rather than the entire item. |
| ETag | A unique identifier used to track changes to an item, ensuring that updates are applied to the correct version. |
| Merge Patch | A type of patch that combines the updated fields with the existing fields, creating a new, updated version of the item. |
| Patch Operation | A specific action performed on an item, such as adding, removing, or replacing a field. |
| SharePoint REST API | A programming interface used to interact with SharePoint, providing endpoints for performing partial updates. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Partial Updates in SharePoint include:
* **Targeted updates**: Updating specific fields or properties of an item, rather than the entire item.
* **ETag-based versioning**: Using ETags to track changes to an item and ensure that updates are applied to the correct version.
* **Merge patching**: Combining updated fields with existing fields to create a new, updated version of an item.
* **Patch operations**: Performing specific actions on an item, such as adding, removing, or replacing a field.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Partial Updates in SharePoint involves using the SharePoint REST API to perform targeted updates on specific fields or properties of an item. This typically involves:
1. Retrieving the current version of the item using the SharePoint REST API.
2. Creating a patch document that specifies the updates to be applied.
3. Applying the patch document to the item using the SharePoint REST API.
4. Verifying that the update was successful and the item has been updated correctly.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Partial Updates in SharePoint include:
* **Updating metadata**: Updating specific metadata fields, such as title, description, or keywords.
* **Updating content**: Updating the content of a document or list item, such as adding or removing text.
* **Updating permissions**: Updating the permissions associated with an item, such as adding or removing users or groups.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Partial Updates in SharePoint include:
* **Using full updates**: Updating the entire item, rather than targeting specific fields or properties.
* **Ignoring ETags**: Failing to use ETags to track changes to an item, which can result in updates being applied to the wrong version.
* **Not verifying updates**: Failing to verify that updates were successful and the item has been updated correctly.
