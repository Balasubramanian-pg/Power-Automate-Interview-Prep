# 33. Renaming Dynamic Tokens with Compose

Canonical documentation for 33. Renaming Dynamic Tokens with Compose. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 33. Renaming Dynamic Tokens with Compose exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of renaming dynamic tokens with Compose is to provide a flexible and efficient way to manage and reuse UI components in a Jetpack Compose application. The problem space includes the need to dynamically update the appearance and behavior of UI components, while maintaining a consistent and predictable user experience. This is particularly important in applications with complex, data-driven UIs, where the same component may need to be reused in different contexts.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Renaming dynamic tokens with Compose involves using a combination of Compose's built-in features, such as `@Composable` functions and `MutableState`, to create reusable UI components that can be easily customized and updated. This approach allows developers to define a set of dynamic tokens, which can be used to parameterize the appearance and behavior of UI components, and then rename these tokens to create new, customized versions of the components.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Dynamic Token | A parameter or value that can be used to customize the appearance or behavior of a UI component |
| Composable Function | A function that returns a UI component, and can be used to define reusable UI elements |
| Mutable State | A type of state that can be updated dynamically, and is used to store the values of dynamic tokens |
| Token Renaming | The process of creating a new, customized version of a UI component by renaming a dynamic token |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of renaming dynamic tokens with Compose include:
* **Parameterization**: The use of dynamic tokens to parameterize the appearance and behavior of UI components
* **Customization**: The ability to create customized versions of UI components by renaming dynamic tokens
* **Reusability**: The ability to reuse UI components in different contexts, while maintaining a consistent and predictable user experience
* **Flexibility**: The ability to dynamically update the appearance and behavior of UI components, in response to changing user needs or application requirements

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for renaming dynamic tokens with Compose involves the following steps:
1. Define a set of dynamic tokens, which can be used to parameterize the appearance and behavior of UI components
2. Create a `@Composable` function that returns a UI component, and uses the dynamic tokens to customize its appearance and behavior
3. Use `MutableState` to store the values of the dynamic tokens, and update these values dynamically in response to user input or other application events
4. Rename the dynamic tokens to create new, customized versions of the UI component

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for renaming dynamic tokens with Compose include:
* **Token-based theming**: Using dynamic tokens to define a set of themes or styles, which can be applied to UI components to customize their appearance
* **Component-based customization**: Using dynamic tokens to customize the behavior of individual UI components, such as buttons or text fields
* **Data-driven UIs**: Using dynamic tokens to create data-driven UIs, where the appearance and behavior of UI components are determined by data from a backend service or database

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for renaming dynamic tokens with Compose include:
* **Hardcoding token values**: Hardcoding the values of dynamic tokens, rather than storing them in `MutableState` and updating them dynamically
* **Overusing token renaming**: Renaming dynamic tokens excessively, which can lead to complexity and maintainability issues
* **Ignoring token scope**: Ignoring the scope of dynamic tokens, which can lead to naming conflicts and other issues
