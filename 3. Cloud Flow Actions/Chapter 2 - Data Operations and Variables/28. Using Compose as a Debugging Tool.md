# 28. Using Compose as a Debugging Tool

Canonical documentation for 28. Using Compose as a Debugging Tool. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 28. Using Compose as a Debugging Tool exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of using Compose as a debugging tool is to simplify and streamline the debugging process for applications built using the Compose framework. Compose provides a set of tools and features that enable developers to identify, diagnose, and fix issues in their applications more efficiently. The class of problems that Compose addresses includes debugging complex UI components, identifying performance bottlenecks, and troubleshooting runtime errors.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Compose is a declarative UI framework that allows developers to build user interfaces using a composable, tree-like structure. When used as a debugging tool, Compose provides a set of features that enable developers to inspect, analyze, and debug their applications at runtime. This includes tools for visualizing the component tree, inspecting component properties, and analyzing performance metrics.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Compose | A declarative UI framework for building user interfaces |
| Component Tree | A tree-like structure representing the hierarchy of UI components in an application |
| Inspector | A tool for visualizing and analyzing the component tree at runtime |
| Debugger | A tool for identifying and fixing errors in an application |
| Performance Metrics | Data points used to measure the performance of an application |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of using Compose as a debugging tool include:
* **Declarative debugging**: Compose's declarative nature allows developers to focus on what the UI should look like, rather than how to achieve it.
* **Component tree analysis**: Compose provides tools for visualizing and analyzing the component tree, making it easier to identify and fix issues.
* **Performance monitoring**: Compose provides features for monitoring and analyzing performance metrics, allowing developers to optimize their applications.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for using Compose as a debugging tool involves the following steps:
1. **Launch the application**: Launch the application in debug mode.
2. **Inspect the component tree**: Use the inspector to visualize and analyze the component tree.
3. **Identify issues**: Identify issues or errors in the application.
4. **Analyze performance metrics**: Analyze performance metrics to identify bottlenecks or areas for optimization.
5. **Fix issues**: Use the debugger to fix issues and optimize the application.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for using Compose as a debugging tool include:
* **Using the inspector to identify layout issues**: The inspector can be used to visualize the component tree and identify layout issues.
* **Using performance metrics to optimize performance**: Performance metrics can be used to identify bottlenecks and optimize the application's performance.
* **Using the debugger to fix runtime errors**: The debugger can be used to identify and fix runtime errors.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for using Compose as a debugging tool include:
* **Over-reliance on print statements**: Relying too heavily on print statements can make it difficult to identify and fix issues.
* **Not using the inspector**: Failing to use the inspector can make it difficult to visualize and analyze the component tree.
* **Not monitoring performance metrics**: Failing to monitor performance metrics can make it difficult to identify and fix performance issues.
