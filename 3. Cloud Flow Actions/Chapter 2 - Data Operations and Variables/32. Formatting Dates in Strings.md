> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 32. Formatting Dates in Strings exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of formatting dates in strings is to provide a standardized and human-readable representation of date and time values. This is essential in various applications, such as data storage, communication, and presentation. The class of problems addressed by date formatting includes inconsistent date representations, incorrect date parsing, and cultural or regional date format variations.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Formatting dates in strings involves converting a date or time value into a string representation, taking into account factors such as date format, time zone, and cultural conventions. This process requires a deep understanding of date and time concepts, including calendars, time zones, and formatting patterns.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Date | A specific point in time, represented by a year, month, and day |
| Time | A specific point in time, represented by an hour, minute, and second |
| Timestamp | A combination of date and time, representing a single point in time |
| Date Format | A pattern or template used to represent dates and times as strings |
| Locale | A set of cultural and regional preferences that influence date and time formatting |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of date formatting include:
* Date and time components (year, month, day, hour, minute, second)
* Date and time formats (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY)
* Time zones and offsets
* Cultural and regional formatting conventions (e.g., locale-specific date and time formats)
* Date and time parsing and validation

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for formatting dates in strings is based on the ISO 8601 standard, which defines a set of formats for representing dates and times. The most commonly used format is the YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ format, which represents a date and time in the UTC time zone.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for formatting dates in strings include:
* Using the ISO 8601 format for date and time representation
* Using locale-specific formats for cultural and regional adaptations
* Using time zones and offsets to handle date and time conversions
* Using date and time parsing and validation libraries to ensure correct formatting

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for formatting dates in strings include:
* Using ambiguous or inconsistent date formats
* Ignoring cultural and regional formatting conventions
* Failing to account for time zones and offsets
* Using custom or proprietary date formatting libraries
