# 43. Parse JSON Core Purpose

Canonical documentation for 43. Parse JSON Core Purpose. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 43. Parse JSON Core Purpose exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of parsing JSON is to interpret and extract data from JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) formatted strings, enabling the data to be used in various applications, such as web services, configuration files, and data exchange between systems. The class of problems it addresses includes data serialization, deserialization, and the need for a lightweight, human-readable data interchange format.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Parsing JSON involves analyzing a JSON string and constructing an in-memory representation of the data, such as a tree-like structure or a dictionary, that can be accessed and manipulated by the application. This process enables the conversion of JSON data into a format that can be used by programming languages, allowing developers to work with the data in a more convenient and efficient way.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| JSON | JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight, human-readable data interchange format. |
| Parser | A software component that analyzes a JSON string and constructs an in-memory representation of the data. |
| Serialization | The process of converting data into a JSON string. |
| Deserialization | The process of converting a JSON string into an in-memory representation of the data. |
| Data Interchange | The process of exchanging data between systems, using JSON as the format. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of parsing JSON include understanding the JSON syntax, recognizing the different data types (such as objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and null), and handling errors and exceptions that may occur during the parsing process. Additionally, understanding the trade-offs between different parsing approaches, such as recursive descent parsing and streaming parsing, is essential.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for parsing JSON involves the following steps: (1) input: reading the JSON string, (2) lexical analysis: breaking the input into tokens, (3) syntax analysis: constructing an abstract syntax tree (AST) from the tokens, and (4) semantic analysis: converting the AST into an in-memory representation of the data. This model provides a foundation for implementing JSON parsers in various programming languages.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in parsing JSON include using a parser generator tool to create a parser from a JSON grammar, implementing a recursive descent parser, and using a streaming parser to parse large JSON files. Additionally, using a JSON library or framework to handle the parsing process is a common pattern, as it provides a convenient and efficient way to work with JSON data.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in parsing JSON include rolling out a custom parser from scratch, without using established libraries or frameworks, and not handling errors and exceptions properly. Additionally, using a parser that is not compliant with the JSON specification, or not considering security concerns, such as protecting against JSON injection attacks, are also discouraged practices.
