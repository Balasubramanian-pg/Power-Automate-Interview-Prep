Canonical documentation for 50. Generating Schema from Sample. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 50. Generating Schema from Sample exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of generating schema from sample is to automate the process of creating a schema that accurately represents the structure of a given dataset. This addresses the problem of manually defining schema, which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and often requires significant expertise. By generating schema from sample, users can quickly and easily create a schema that can be used for data validation, data transformation, and data integration.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Generating schema from sample involves analyzing a sample dataset to identify patterns, relationships, and constraints. This information is then used to create a schema that defines the structure of the data, including data types, field names, and relationships between fields. The resulting schema can be used to validate, transform, and integrate data from various sources.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Schema | A blueprint or model that defines the structure of a dataset, including data types, field names, and relationships between fields. |
| Sample Dataset | A representative subset of data used to generate a schema. |
| Data Type | A category of data, such as integer, string, or date, that defines the type of value a field can hold. |
| Field | A single column or attribute in a dataset. |
| Relationship | A connection or association between two or more fields in a dataset. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of generating schema from sample include:
* **Data Profiling**: The process of analyzing a sample dataset to identify patterns, relationships, and constraints.
* **Schema Inference**: The process of using data profiling results to generate a schema that defines the structure of the data.
* **Data Type Detection**: The process of identifying the data type of each field in the sample dataset.
* **Relationship Detection**: The process of identifying relationships between fields in the sample dataset.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for generating schema from sample involves the following steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Collect a representative sample dataset.
2. **Data Profiling**: Analyze the sample dataset to identify patterns, relationships, and constraints.
3. **Schema Inference**: Use data profiling results to generate a schema that defines the structure of the data.
4. **Schema Refining**: Refine the generated schema based on additional data or user input.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for generating schema from sample include:
* **Using statistical methods**: Such as mean, median, and standard deviation to identify data types and relationships.
* **Using machine learning algorithms**: Such as decision trees and clustering to identify patterns and relationships in the data.
* **Using data quality metrics**: Such as data completeness and consistency to evaluate the quality of the generated schema.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for generating schema from sample include:
* **Over-reliance on manual schema definition**: Manually defining schema can be time-consuming and error-prone.
* **Using incomplete or biased sample datasets**: Using incomplete or biased sample datasets can result in inaccurate or incomplete schema.
* **Ignoring data quality issues**: Ignoring data quality issues can result in schema that do not accurately represent the structure of the data.
