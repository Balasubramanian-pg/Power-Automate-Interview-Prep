Canonical documentation for 48. Working with JSON in SharePoint Columns. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 48. Working with JSON in SharePoint Columns exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Working with JSON in SharePoint columns addresses the need to store and manage complex, structured data within SharePoint lists and libraries. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) provides a lightweight, flexible format for representing data, making it an ideal choice for storing and exchanging data between different systems and applications. The ability to work with JSON in SharePoint columns enables developers and power users to create custom solutions that leverage the power of JSON data, such as storing configuration settings, user preferences, or other types of structured data.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model for working with JSON in SharePoint columns involves using JSON data to store and manage complex data structures within SharePoint lists and libraries. This model includes the following key components:
* JSON data: The actual JSON data stored in the SharePoint column.
* SharePoint column: The column in the SharePoint list or library where the JSON data is stored.
* Data serialization: The process of converting JSON data into a format that can be stored in the SharePoint column.
* Data deserialization: The process of converting the stored data back into JSON format for use in custom solutions.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| JSON | JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data interchange format. |
| SharePoint column | A column in a SharePoint list or library where data is stored. |
| Data serialization | The process of converting data into a format that can be stored or transmitted. |
| Data deserialization | The process of converting stored or transmitted data back into its original format. |
| Column formatting | The process of customizing the display of data in a SharePoint column using JSON. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts for working with JSON in SharePoint columns include:
* Using JSON to store complex, structured data in SharePoint columns.
* Serializing and deserializing JSON data to store and retrieve it from SharePoint columns.
* Using column formatting to customize the display of JSON data in SharePoint columns.
* Leveraging JSON data to create custom solutions, such as storing configuration settings or user preferences.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for working with JSON in SharePoint columns involves using the SharePoint `Text` column type to store JSON data. This model includes the following best practices:
* Use the `Text` column type to store JSON data.
* Use a consistent naming convention for JSON properties and values.
* Use a consistent formatting style for JSON data.
* Use column formatting to customize the display of JSON data.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for working with JSON in SharePoint columns include:
* Storing configuration settings or user preferences in JSON format.
* Using JSON data to customize the display of SharePoint columns.
* Leveraging JSON data to create custom solutions, such as integrating with external systems or applications.
* Using JSON data to store and manage complex, structured data in SharePoint lists and libraries.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for working with JSON in SharePoint columns include:
* Storing large amounts of JSON data in a single column, which can impact performance.
* Using inconsistent naming conventions or formatting styles for JSON properties and values.
* Failing to use column formatting to customize the display of JSON data.
* Using JSON data to store sensitive or secure information, such as passwords or encryption keys.
