# 45. When to Use Parse JSON

Canonical documentation for 45. When to Use Parse JSON. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 45. When to Use Parse JSON exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Parse JSON action is designed to parse JSON data from various sources, such as HTTP responses, files, or strings, and convert it into a format that can be easily processed and utilized within a workflow or application. This action addresses the problem of working with JSON data in a structured and efficient manner, allowing users to extract specific information, perform data transformations, and integrate JSON data with other systems and services.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Parse JSON action takes JSON data as input, analyzes its structure, and generates an output that represents the parsed data in a hierarchical format. This output can then be used to access specific values, arrays, or objects within the original JSON data. The action supports various JSON formats, including JSON objects, arrays, and nested structures, and can handle common JSON data types such as strings, numbers, booleans, and null values.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| JSON | JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data interchange format |
| Parse | The process of analyzing and interpreting JSON data to extract its structure and content |
| JSON Object | A collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a string and each value can be a string, number, boolean, array, or another JSON object |
| JSON Array | An ordered list of values, which can be strings, numbers, booleans, or other JSON arrays or objects |
| Nested Structure | A JSON object or array that contains other JSON objects or arrays as values |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Parse JSON action include:
* **JSON parsing**: The process of analyzing JSON data to extract its structure and content.
* **Data transformation**: The process of converting parsed JSON data into a format that can be easily processed and utilized within a workflow or application.
* **Data access**: The ability to access specific values, arrays, or objects within the parsed JSON data.
* **Error handling**: The ability to handle errors and exceptions that may occur during the parsing process, such as invalid JSON syntax or missing values.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for using the Parse JSON action involves the following steps:
1. **Input**: Provide the JSON data to be parsed, either as a string, file, or HTTP response.
2. **Parsing**: Use the Parse JSON action to analyze the JSON data and generate an output that represents the parsed data.
3. **Data access**: Use the parsed data to access specific values, arrays, or objects within the original JSON data.
4. **Data transformation**: Convert the parsed data into a format that can be easily processed and utilized within a workflow or application.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for using the Parse JSON action include:
* **Parsing JSON responses from APIs**: Using the Parse JSON action to parse JSON data returned from APIs, such as RESTful web services or microservices.
* **Processing JSON files**: Using the Parse JSON action to parse JSON data stored in files, such as configuration files or data files.
* **Transforming JSON data**: Using the Parse JSON action to transform JSON data into a format that can be easily processed and utilized within a workflow or application.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for using the Parse JSON action include:
* **Not handling errors**: Failing to handle errors and exceptions that may occur during the parsing process, such as invalid JSON syntax or missing values.
* **Not validating input**: Failing to validate the input JSON data to ensure it is well-formed and valid.
* **Using incorrect data types**: Using incorrect data types to access or transform the parsed JSON data, such as using a string to access a numeric value.
