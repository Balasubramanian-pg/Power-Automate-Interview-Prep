# 46. Handling HTTP Responses with Parse JSON

Canonical documentation for 46. Handling HTTP Responses with Parse JSON. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 46. Handling HTTP Responses with Parse JSON exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of handling HTTP responses with Parse JSON is to provide a standardized approach to processing and extracting data from HTTP responses that contain JSON data. This addresses the problem of inconsistent and error-prone methods for parsing JSON data from HTTP responses, which can lead to issues with data integrity, security, and system reliability. By using a standardized approach to parsing JSON data, developers can ensure that their applications are more robust, maintainable, and scalable.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of handling HTTP responses with Parse JSON involves the following key components:
- HTTP client: sends an HTTP request to a server
- HTTP server: responds with an HTTP response containing JSON data
- Parse JSON: a process that extracts and transforms the JSON data into a usable format
- Application: utilizes the parsed JSON data for further processing, storage, or display

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| HTTP | Hypertext Transfer Protocol, a standard protocol for transferring data over the internet |
| JSON | JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data interchange format |
| Parse | to analyze and extract data from a format, such as JSON |
| HTTP Response | a message sent by a server in response to an HTTP request |
| HTTP Client | a software component that sends HTTP requests to a server |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of handling HTTP responses with Parse JSON include:
- Understanding the structure and syntax of JSON data
- Familiarity with HTTP protocols and response codes
- Knowledge of parsing techniques and libraries
- Error handling and debugging strategies
- Security considerations for processing and storing JSON data

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for handling HTTP responses with Parse JSON involves the following steps:
1. Send an HTTP request to the server using an HTTP client
2. Receive the HTTP response from the server
3. Check the HTTP response code to ensure it indicates a successful response (e.g., 200 OK)
4. Extract the JSON data from the HTTP response body
5. Parse the JSON data using a parsing library or framework
6. Process and utilize the parsed JSON data in the application

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for handling HTTP responses with Parse JSON include:
- Using a parsing library or framework to simplify the parsing process
- Implementing error handling and debugging mechanisms to handle parsing errors
- Utilizing caching or storage mechanisms to optimize performance and reduce the number of HTTP requests
- Applying security measures to protect against JSON-based attacks or vulnerabilities

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for handling HTTP responses with Parse JSON include:
- Using eval() or other insecure methods to parse JSON data
- Failing to check HTTP response codes or handle errors properly
- Not validating or sanitizing JSON data before processing or storing it
- Using outdated or insecure parsing libraries or frameworks
