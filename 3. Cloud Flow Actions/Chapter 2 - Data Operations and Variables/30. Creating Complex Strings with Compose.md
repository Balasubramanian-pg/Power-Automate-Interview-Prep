Canonical documentation for 30. Creating Complex Strings with Compose. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 30. Creating Complex Strings with Compose exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Creating Complex Strings with Compose is to provide a flexible and efficient way to construct complex strings from various data sources, addressing the need for dynamic string creation in various applications, such as data processing, reporting, and user interface development. The problem space includes scenarios where strings need to be generated based on multiple factors, including user input, data from databases or files, and environmental variables.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Creating Complex Strings with Compose involves breaking down the string creation process into smaller, manageable components, and then combining these components using a compositional approach. This approach allows for the creation of complex strings by defining a set of basic building blocks, such as string literals, variables, and functions, and then combining these blocks using a set of predefined rules and operators.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Compose | A function or operation that combines two or more strings into a single string. |
| String Template | A predefined string pattern that contains placeholders for dynamic values. |
| Variable | A named value that can be used in a string template to insert dynamic content. |
| Function | A reusable block of code that can be used to generate dynamic content for a string. |
| Operator | A symbol or keyword used to combine strings, variables, and functions in a compose operation. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Creating Complex Strings with Compose include:
* **String templating**: defining a string pattern with placeholders for dynamic values.
* **Variable substitution**: replacing placeholders in a string template with actual values.
* **Function invocation**: using functions to generate dynamic content for a string.
* **Compose operations**: combining strings, variables, and functions using operators.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Creating Complex Strings with Compose involves the following steps:
1. Define a string template with placeholders for dynamic values.
2. Identify the variables and functions required to populate the template.
3. Use compose operations to combine the template, variables, and functions.
4. Evaluate the composed string to generate the final output.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Creating Complex Strings with Compose include:
* **String concatenation**: combining multiple strings using a concatenation operator.
* **Variable interpolation**: inserting variable values into a string template using placeholders.
* **Function composition**: combining multiple functions to generate dynamic content.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Creating Complex Strings with Compose include:
* **Hardcoding values**: embedding static values directly into a string template.
* **Using complex conditional logic**: incorporating complex conditional statements into a string template.
* **Ignoring error handling**: failing to handle errors and exceptions that may occur during string composition.
