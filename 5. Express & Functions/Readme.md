# The Ultimate Masterclass on Power Automate Expressions & Functions

## Part 1: The "Why" - Beyond the Dynamic Content Picker

### Introduction: The Language of Logic

*   While **Dynamic Content** provides a user-friendly way to pass data between steps in a flow, it is fundamentally limited. It can only pass whole "tokens" of data exactly as they are received. To build truly intelligent, robust, and powerful automations, you need to be able to manipulate this data: format it, calculate with it, transform it, and make complex logical decisions based on it.
*   **Expressions** are the key that unlocks this power. They are a rich set of functions, based on the **Workflow Definition Language (WDL)**, that allow you to perform these advanced data manipulations.
*   Mastering expressions is the single most important skill that separates a novice flow builder from a professional automation developer. It is the difference between building a simple notification flow and building a complex data processing engine that can handle any business requirement thrown at it.
*   Expressions are used *inside* the input fields of triggers and actions. You access the expression editor by clicking inside an input field and selecting the "Expression" tab instead of "Dynamic content."

### The Relationship Between Dynamic Content and Expressions

*   It's crucial to understand that dynamic content and expressions are two sides of the same coin. Every piece of dynamic content is simply a user-friendly wrapper for an underlying expression.
*   **The Learning Bridge:**
    1.  Select an input field.
    2.  Click to add dynamic content (e.g., the `Subject` from an email trigger).
    3.  **Now, hover over that dynamic content token.** A tooltip will appear showing you the exact expression that the token represents, such as `triggerBody()?['Subject']`.
*   This is the best way to learn the syntax for referencing outputs. You start with the friendly name and learn the underlying code that powers it.

### The Structure of an Expression

*   Expressions look like formulas in Excel or other programming languages. They consist of function names, parentheses, and parameters, often nested together.
*   **`functionName(parameter1, parameter2, ...)`**
*   **Example:** `concat('Hello, ', triggerBody()?['name'])`
    *   **`concat()`:** The function name.
    *   **`'Hello, '`:** A static string literal parameter. String literals are always enclosed in single quotes `' '`.
    *   **`triggerBody()?['name']`:** A dynamic parameter that gets the `name` property from the body of the flow's trigger. This is itself a simple expression.
*   Expressions are case-insensitive, but a consistent casing (like camelCase for functions) is a best practice for readability.
*   > [!IMPORTANT]
    > While the editor adds an `@` symbol in front of the expression (`@{...}`) when you save it, you **do not** type the `@` yourself in the expression editor window. You only type the formula, like `concat(...)`.

## Part 2: String Functions - The Workhorses of Text Manipulation

*   Text (string) manipulation is required in almost every flow, whether you're building a filename, creating a subject line for an email, or parsing data from a text field.

### `concat()`

*   **Purpose:** Joins two or more strings together into a single string.
*   **Syntax:** `concat(string1, string2, ...)`
*   **Example:** Create a unique filename for an invoice.
    ```wdl
    concat(
      'Invoice_',
      triggerBody()?['body/VendorName'],
      '_',
      formatDateTime(utcNow(), 'yyyyMMdd_HHmmss'),
      '.pdf'
    )
    ```
    *   **Result:** `Invoice_ContosoInc_20231026_143000.pdf`

### `substring()`

*   **Purpose:** Extracts a part of a string, starting from a specific character position.
*   **Syntax:** `substring(text, startIndex, length)`
*   **Key Detail:** The `startIndex` is zero-based, meaning the first character is at position 0.
*   **Example:** Get the first 100 characters of an email body to use as a summary.
    ```wdl
    substring(triggerBody()?['body'], 0, 100)
    ```

### `replace()`

*   **Purpose:** Finds all occurrences of a substring within a larger string and replaces them with a different substring.
*   **Syntax:** `replace(originalString, oldText, newText)`
*   **Example:** Sanitize a filename by replacing spaces with underscores.
    ```wdl
    replace(outputs('Get_file_properties')?['body/Name'], ' ', '_')
    ```
    *   `'My Report For Q3.docx'` becomes `'My_Report_For_Q3.docx'`

### `split()`

*   **Purpose:** Takes a string and splits it into an **array** of substrings, based on a specified delimiter character. This is incredibly powerful for parsing structured text.
*   **Syntax:** `split(text, delimiter)`
*   **Example:** An email arrives with a subject like "New Task: Project Alpha|High|John Doe". We need to parse this into individual pieces of data.
    ```wdl
    split(triggerBody()?['Subject'], '|')
    ```
    *   **Result:** This expression returns an array: `["New Task: Project Alpha", "High", "John Doe"]`.
    *   To access an individual element, you use an index in a subsequent `Compose` action or input field:
        *   `outputs('Compose_Split_Subject')[0]` would be "New Task: Project Alpha"
        *   `outputs('Compose_Split_Subject')[1]` would be "High"
        *   `outputs('Compose_Split_Subject')[2]` would be "John Doe"

### `toLower()` / `toUpper()`

*   **Purpose:** Converts a string to all lowercase or all uppercase. This is essential for case-insensitive comparisons.
*   **Syntax:** `toLower(text)` or `toUpper(text)`
*   **Example:** In a `Condition`, check if an email subject contains the word "urgent", regardless of how it's cased ("URGENT", "Urgent", "urgent").
    ```wdl
    // Instead of using the 'contains' operator, we check for equality after converting to lowercase.
    // Left side of condition (in advanced mode):
    @toLower(triggerBody()?['Subject'])

    // Operator: contains

    // Right side of condition:
    urgent
    ```

### Flashcard Q&A: String Functions

*   **Q:** What function would you use to join a user's first name and last name into a single "FullName" string?
*   **A:** `concat(variables('FirstName'), ' ', variables('LastName'))`

*   **Q:** Your flow receives a comma-separated string of email addresses: "a@b.com,c@d.com,e@f.com". What function must you use to turn this into an array so you can loop through it with an `Apply to each`?
*   **A:** `split('a@b.com,c@d.com,e@f.com', ',')`

*   **Q:** What is the most common use case for the `toLower()` or `toUpper()` functions?
*   **A:** To perform case-insensitive string comparisons.

## Part 3: Logical & Comparison Functions - The Heart of Conditions

*   These functions are the building blocks of `Condition` actions and are used to evaluate logical statements, always returning either `true` or `false`. While you can build conditions in the simple UI, writing them in advanced mode using these functions gives you more power and control.

### `equals()`

*   **Purpose:** Checks if two values are exactly equal.
*   **Syntax:** `equals(value1, value2)`
*   **Example:** `equals(triggerBody()?['Status'], 'Completed')` -> Returns `true` or `false`.

### `greater()`, `less()`, `greaterOrEquals()`, `lessOrEquals()`

*   **Purpose:** Perform numerical or chronological comparisons.
*   **Syntax:** `greater(value1, value2)`
*   **Example:** Check if an invoice amount is over the approval threshold.
    ```wdl
    greater(float(triggerBody()?['InvoiceAmount']), 1000.00)
    ```
    *   > [!NOTE]
        > I've included the `float()` function here. This is crucial. When a value comes from a trigger, it is often treated as a string, even if it looks like a number. You must explicitly convert it to a number type (`float` for decimals, `int` for integers) before performing mathematical comparisons.

### `and()`, `or()`

*   **Purpose:** Combine multiple logical statements.
*   **`and()`:** Returns `true` only if *all* of its parameters are true.
*   **`or()`:** Returns `true` if *at least one* of its parameters is true.
*   **Syntax:** `and(logical_expression1, logical_expression2)`
*   **Example:** Check if an order is high-value *and* comes from a specific region.
    ```wdl
    and(
      greater(float(triggerBody()?['Amount']), 5000),
      equals(triggerBody()?['Region'], 'West')
    )
    ```

### `not()`

*   **Purpose:** Inverts a logical value. `not(true)` becomes `false`, and `not(false)` becomes `true`.
*   **Syntax:** `not(logical_expression)`
*   **Example:** A trigger condition to stop an infinite loop in SharePoint. "Run this flow only if the Status is NOT 'Processed by Flow'".
    ```wdl
    @not(equals(triggerBody()?['Status']?['Value'], 'Processed by Flow'))
    ```

### `empty()` / `coalesce()`

*   **`empty()`:** Checks if an object, string, or array is empty. Returns `true` or `false`. Useful for checking if `Get items` returned any results.
*   **`coalesce()`:** A powerful function for providing a default value. It checks a series of values in order and returns the *first one that is not null*.
*   **Syntax:** `coalesce(value_to_check1, value_to_check2, fallback_value)`
*   **Example:** An input form has an "Office Phone" and a "Mobile Phone" field. We want to get the office phone, but if it's blank, use the mobile phone, and if that's also blank, use a generic number.
    ```wdl
    coalesce(triggerBody()?['OfficePhone'], triggerBody()?['MobilePhone'], '555-0100')
    ```
    *   This one-line expression replaces a complex nested `if` condition.

### Flashcard Q&A: Logical Functions

*   **Q:** What two functions are used to combine multiple logical checks, requiring either all of them or just one of them to be true?
*   **A:** `and()` (all must be true) and `or()` (at least one must be true).

*   **Q:** You receive an amount from a Microsoft Form, which comes in as a string. Which function must you wrap it in before you can use `greater()` to compare it to the number 100?
*   **A:** Either `int()` (for whole numbers) or `float()` (for decimal numbers).

*   **Q:** You want to provide a default value of "N/A" for a field only if the incoming data is null or empty. What single function can achieve this?
*   **A:** The `coalesce()` function. `coalesce(triggerBody()?['OptionalField'], 'N/A')`.

## Part 4: Math, Date/Time, and Array Functions

### Mathematical Functions

*   These are straightforward functions for performing calculations. Remember to convert string inputs to `int` or `float` first!
*   **`add(num1, num2)`:** Adds two numbers.
*   **`sub(num1, num2)`:** Subtracts the second number from the first.
*   **`mul(num1, num2)`:** Multiplies two numbers.
*   **`div(num1, num2)`:** Divides the first number by the second.
*   **`rand(min, max)`:** Generates a random integer between the min and max values.
*   **Example (Inside `Set variable`):** `add(variables('Counter'), 1)`

### Date and Time Functions

*   Handling dates and times is a common requirement, especially regarding time zones.
*   **`utcNow()`:** Returns the current date and time as a string in **Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)**. This is the global standard time and the recommended format for logging timestamps.
*   **`formatDateTime()`:** The most important date/time function. It takes a date/time string and converts it into a specific format.
    *   **Syntax:** `formatDateTime(timestamp, format_string)`
    *   **Example:** Get the current date in a simple, file-safe format.
        *   `formatDateTime(utcNow(), 'yyyy-MM-dd')` -> "2023-10-26"
    *   **Example:** Get a friendly, readable format for an email.
        *   `formatDateTime(triggerBody()?['DueDate'], 'dddd, MMMM d, yyyy')` -> "Thursday, October 26, 2023"
*   **`addDays()`, `addHours()`, `addMinutes()`, etc.:**
    *   Performs date arithmetic.
    *   **Syntax:** `addDays(timestamp, days_to_add)`
    *   **Example:** Calculate a due date that is 7 days from now.
        *   `addDays(utcNow(), 7)`
*   **`convertTimeZone()`:**
    *   The essential function for converting a timestamp from one time zone to another (typically from UTC to a local time).
    *   **Syntax:** `convertTimeZone(timestamp, sourceTimeZone, destinationTimeZone, [format_string])`
    *   **Example:** Convert the UTC trigger time to Eastern Standard Time for an email.
        ```wdl
        convertTimeZone(triggerBody()?['EventTime'], 'UTC', 'Eastern Standard Time', 'g')
        ```
        *   **Result:** `10/26/2023 10:30 AM`

### Array Functions

*   These functions are used to manipulate arrays, often the output of `Get items` or `split()`.
*   **`length()`:** Returns the number of items in an array.
    *   **Syntax:** `length(array)`
    *   **Example (In a `Condition`):** Check if a `Get items` call found any records before proceeding.
        *   `length(outputs('Get_items')?['body/value'])` **is greater than** `0`.
*   **`first()` / `last()`:**
    *   Returns the first or the last item from an array.
    *   **Syntax:** `first(array)`
    *   **Example:** After getting a list of project tasks sorted by due date, get the very first one due.
        *   `first(outputs('Get_items')?['body/value'])?['Title']`
*   **`skip()` / `take()`:**
    *   **`skip(array, count)`:** Returns an array, but with the first `count` items removed.
    *   **`take(array, count)`:** Returns a new array containing only the first `count` items from the original.
*   **`union()` / `intersection()`:**
    *   Performs set logic on two arrays, finding the combined unique items or only the items that appear in both.
*   **`join()`:** The opposite of `split`. It takes an array and joins all its elements into a single string using a delimiter.
    *   **Syntax:** `join(array, delimiter)`
    *   **Example:** Take an array of approver names and turn it into a single, comma-separated string for an email.
        *   `join(variables('ApproverNames'), ', ')` -> `"John Doe, Jane Smith"`

### Flashcard Q&A: Math, Date, and Arrays

*   **Q:** What function returns the current date and time, and in what time zone?
*   **A:** `utcNow()`, which returns the time in **UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)**.

*   **Q:** You need to get just the first item from the array of results returned by a `Get items` action. What function do you use?
*   **A:** The `first()` function: `first(outputs('Get_items')?['body/value'])`.

*   **Q:** You want to check if a `Get items` SharePoint action returned any records. How would you do this in a `Condition`?
*   **A:** Use the `length()` function on the output value array: `length(outputs('Get_items')?['body/value'])` is greater than `0`.

## Part 5: The Crucial Role of JSON Handling Expressions

*   As you build more advanced flows, you will inevitably interact with services that communicate using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). Power Automate provides two critical functions for handling this.

### `json()`: Stringifying Your Data

*   **Purpose:** The `json()` function takes a complex object or an array from Power Automate (like the body of an HTTP request, a file, or a variable) and converts it into a well-formatted **JSON text string**.
*   **This is "stringification."**
*   **Why is this needed?** Many API endpoints expect their input `body` to be a string formatted as JSON. You cannot simply pass a Power Automate `Object` variable to an HTTP action's body; you must first convert it to a string representation.
*   **Syntax:** `json(value)`
*   **Realistic Scenario: Calling a Custom API**
    1.  An `Initialize variable` action creates a variable named `requestObject` of type `Object`.
    2.  `Set variable` actions populate the object: `{"user": {"name": "John", "id": 123}, "action": "submit"}`
    3.  `HTTP` Action:
        *   **Method:** POST
        *   **Body:** `json(variables('requestObject'))` -> This expression takes the object and turns it into the text string that the API requires.

### `parseJSON()`: From String to Structure

*   **Purpose:** This is the opposite of `json()`. It takes a **JSON-formatted text string** and parses it into a structured Power Automate object, making its individual properties available as dynamic content.
*   **This is "parsing."**
*   **Why is this needed?** While the `HTTP` action automatically tries to parse JSON responses, sometimes the response body is just a string that happens to contain JSON. This is also common with data stored in SharePoint multi-line text fields or data from services like Microsoft Forms. Without `parseJSON()`, you have a single block of text and no way to access the properties within it.
*   **The Action vs. The Expression:** It's important to note the difference between the `Parse JSON` **action** and the `parseJSON()` **expression function**.
    *   **`Parse JSON` Action (Recommended):** This action provides a UI where you can generate a schema from a sample. This is the best practice because it creates strongly typed dynamic content tokens, giving you a better and safer authoring experience.
    *   **`parseJSON()` Expression:** You can use this function inline to quickly parse a string. However, the output is a dynamic object, and you have to access its properties using a more verbose syntax like `parseJSON(variables('jsonString'))?['propertyName']`. The dedicated action is almost always the better choice.
*   **Syntax:** `parseJSON(jsonString)`
*   **Realistic Scenario: Reading Configuration from a SharePoint List**
    *   A SharePoint list "AppConfig" has a multi-line text column `ConfigJSON`.
    *   One item has this in its `ConfigJSON` column: `{"notificationEmail": "admins@company.com", "retryLimit": 5}`.
    1.  `Get item` to retrieve the config item.
    2.  `Compose` Action named `Parse the Config`:
        *   **Input:** `parseJSON(outputs('Get_item')?['body/ConfigJSON'])`
    3.  `Send an email` action:
        *   **To:** `outputs('Parse_the_Config')?['notificationEmail']`
        *   This allows you to create dynamic, configuration-driven flows where settings are stored externally in a list rather than being hardcoded in the flow itself.

### Final Best Practices for Expressions

*   **Use `Compose` to Build and Debug:** When writing a complex, nested expression, build it piece by piece in separate `Compose` actions. Check the output of each one to ensure it's correct before nesting them together.
*   **Handle Nulls Gracefully:** Use the `?` operator after object names (`triggerBody()?['optionalProperty']`) and the `coalesce()` function to prevent your flows from failing when they encounter missing or null data.
*   **Format for Readability:** Don't be afraid to add line breaks and indentation in the expression editor. The engine ignores the whitespace, but it makes your code infinitely more readable for you and your colleagues.
*   **Add Notes:** Use the "Add a note" feature (`...` menu) on any action that contains a complex expression to explain, in plain English, what the expression is doing and why. This is crucial for long-term maintainability.
