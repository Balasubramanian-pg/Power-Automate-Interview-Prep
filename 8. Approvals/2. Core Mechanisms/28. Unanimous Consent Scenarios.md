## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 28. Unanimous Consent Scenarios exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Unanimous Consent Scenarios exist to facilitate efficient and effective decision-making processes within groups, addressing the problem of achieving consensus among all members. This is particularly crucial in situations where a unified agreement is required, such as in legislative bodies, corporate board meetings, or community gatherings. The primary challenge this scenario aims to solve is ensuring that all parties are in complete agreement, thereby avoiding potential conflicts or disputes that could arise from partial or majority-based decisions.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of Unanimous Consent Scenarios revolves around the principle of achieving a collective agreement among all members of a group. This involves a process where proposals are made, discussed, and then either accepted or rejected by every individual. The model assumes that all participants have an equal say and that no decision is finalized unless every member agrees to it. This approach emphasizes cooperation, mutual respect, and the importance of considering every perspective to reach a common goal.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Unanimous Consent | A decision-making process where all members of a group agree on a proposal or decision. |
| Consensus | A collective agreement or opinion reached by a group, often through discussion and negotiation. |
| Proposal | A suggestion or plan put forward for consideration by a group. |
| Veto Power | The ability of an individual to reject a proposal, thereby preventing it from being adopted. |
| Quorum | The minimum number of members required to be present for a group to make decisions. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Unanimous Consent Scenarios include the requirement for total agreement, the equal participation of all members, and the iterative process of proposal, discussion, and decision. These concepts are grounded in the principles of democracy, equality, and the pursuit of collective well-being. They also underscore the importance of communication, negotiation, and compromise in achieving unanimous consent.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Unanimous Consent Scenarios typically involves the following steps:
1. **Introduction of a Proposal**: A member introduces a proposal to the group.
2. **Discussion**: The group discusses the proposal, allowing all members to express their thoughts, concerns, and suggestions.
3. **Amendments**: Based on the discussion, the proposal may be amended to better reflect the group's preferences.
4. **Call for Consent**: The group leader or facilitator calls for unanimous consent on the proposal.
5. **Decision**: If all members agree, the proposal is adopted. If any member objects, the proposal is either sent back for further discussion or rejected.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Unanimous Consent Scenarios include:
- **Standing Committees**: Smaller groups within the larger body that focus on specific issues and make recommendations.
- **Proxy Voting**: Allowing members to delegate their voting power to another member, often used when a member cannot be present.
- **Consensus Building**: Techniques and strategies used to facilitate agreement, such as mediation, negotiation, and compromise.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Unanimous Consent Scenarios include:
- **Majority Rule**: Ignoring the requirement for unanimous consent and instead adopting decisions based on a majority vote.
- **Lack of Transparency**: Failing to clearly communicate proposals, discussions, and decisions to all members.
- **Coercion**: Using pressure or influence to force members into agreement, rather than achieving genuine consensus.
