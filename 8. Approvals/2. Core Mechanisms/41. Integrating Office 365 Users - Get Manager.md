# 41. Integrating Office 365 Users - Get Manager

Canonical documentation for 41. Integrating Office 365 Users - Get Manager. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 41. Integrating Office 365 Users - Get Manager exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of integrating Office 365 users with the "Get Manager" functionality is to enable seamless retrieval of a user's manager within an organization. This integration addresses the problem of manually searching for or maintaining a list of employee-manager relationships, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. By leveraging the Microsoft Graph API, organizations can automate the process of retrieving a user's manager, thereby streamlining various HR and administrative tasks.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of integrating Office 365 users with the "Get Manager" functionality involves understanding the Microsoft Graph API, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), and the relationships between users and their managers within an organization. The Microsoft Graph API provides a unified programmability model that allows developers to access the tremendous amount of data in Microsoft 365, including user and manager relationships.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Microsoft Graph API | A RESTful web API that provides access to Microsoft 365 data, including users, groups, and relationships |
| Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) | A cloud-based identity and access management service that provides user authentication and authorization |
| User Principal Name (UPN) | A unique identifier for a user in Azure AD, typically in the format of username@domain |
| Manager | The user's supervisor or reporting manager within an organization |
| Microsoft 365 | A suite of productivity and collaboration tools, including Office 365, that provides a range of services for organizations |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of integrating Office 365 users with the "Get Manager" functionality include:
* Understanding the Microsoft Graph API and its endpoints for retrieving user and manager relationships
* Authenticating and authorizing API requests using Azure AD
* Using the User Principal Name (UPN) to identify and retrieve a user's manager
* Handling errors and exceptions when retrieving manager relationships

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for integrating Office 365 users with the "Get Manager" functionality involves the following steps:
1. Registering an Azure AD application and granting the necessary permissions to access the Microsoft Graph API
2. Authenticating and authorizing API requests using Azure AD
3. Using the Microsoft Graph API to retrieve a user's manager relationship
4. Handling errors and exceptions when retrieving manager relationships

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns when integrating Office 365 users with the "Get Manager" functionality include:
* Using the Microsoft Graph API to retrieve a user's manager relationship and then using that information to automate HR and administrative tasks
* Implementing caching mechanisms to reduce the number of API requests and improve performance
* Using Azure AD groups to manage access to the Microsoft Graph API and restrict access to sensitive data

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns when integrating Office 365 users with the "Get Manager" functionality include:
* Hardcoding user credentials or using insecure authentication mechanisms
* Failing to handle errors and exceptions when retrieving manager relationships
* Using outdated or deprecated API endpoints
* Ignoring Azure AD permissions and access controls
