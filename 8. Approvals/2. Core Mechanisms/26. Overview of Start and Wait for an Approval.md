> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 26. Overview of Start and Wait for an Approval exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Start and Wait for an Approval is to provide a structured approach to managing approval workflows, ensuring that all necessary stakeholders are involved and that decisions are made in a transparent and accountable manner. This addresses the class of problems related to inefficient approval processes, lack of visibility, and inadequate control, which can lead to delays, errors, and non-compliance.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Start and Wait for an Approval process involves initiating a request for approval, routing it to the designated approver(s), and waiting for their response. This process can be repeated for multiple levels of approval, with each level building on the previous one. The process is typically triggered by a specific event or condition, such as the submission of a request or the completion of a task.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approval | The act of granting official sanction or consent to a request or proposal. |
| Approver | The individual or group responsible for reviewing and deciding on a request or proposal. |
| Requester | The individual or group submitting a request or proposal for approval. |
| Workflow | The series of activities, tasks, and processes involved in managing an approval request from initiation to completion. |
| Threshold | The minimum number of approvals required for a request or proposal to be considered approved. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Start and Wait for an Approval include:
* **Approval thresholds**: The minimum number of approvals required for a request or proposal to be considered approved.
* **Approval routing**: The process of directing a request or proposal to the designated approver(s) for review and decision.
* **Approval levels**: The hierarchical structure of approvers, with each level building on the previous one.
* **Request tracking**: The ability to monitor the status and progress of a request or proposal throughout the approval process.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Start and Wait for an Approval involves the following steps:
1. **Initiation**: The requester submits a request or proposal for approval.
2. **Routing**: The request is directed to the designated approver(s) for review and decision.
3. **Review**: The approver(s) review the request and make a decision.
4. **Response**: The approver(s) respond with their decision, which can be either approval, rejection, or request for additional information.
5. **Notification**: The requester is notified of the decision and any subsequent actions required.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Start and Wait for an Approval include:
* **Serial approval**: A linear approval process where each approver reviews and decides on the request in sequence.
* **Parallel approval**: A concurrent approval process where multiple approvers review and decide on the request simultaneously.
* **Escalation**: The process of elevating a request to a higher-level approver when the initial approver is unavailable or unable to make a decision.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Start and Wait for an Approval include:
* **Lack of transparency**: Failing to provide clear visibility into the approval process and decision-making criteria.
* **Inconsistent approval criteria**: Applying different approval criteria to similar requests or proposals.
* **Insufficient tracking**: Failing to monitor the status and progress of requests or proposals throughout the approval process.
