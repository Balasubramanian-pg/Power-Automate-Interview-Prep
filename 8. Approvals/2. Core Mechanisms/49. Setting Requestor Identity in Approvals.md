> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 49. Setting Requestor Identity in Approvals exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Setting Requestor Identity in Approvals is to ensure that the identity of the requestor is accurately captured and associated with their approval requests. This addresses the problem of authenticity and accountability in approval workflows, where it is crucial to know who initiated a request and to verify their identity throughout the approval process. By setting the requestor identity, organizations can maintain a clear audit trail, prevent unauthorized requests, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of Setting Requestor Identity in Approvals involves capturing the requestor's identity at the inception of an approval request and maintaining this information throughout the approval workflow. This model encompasses the following key components: 
1. **Requestor Identification**: The process of capturing the requestor's identity, which may involve user authentication, role-based identification, or other forms of identity verification.
2. **Approval Workflow**: The series of steps and decisions involved in approving or rejecting a request, during which the requestor's identity remains associated with the request.
3. **Identity Persistence**: The mechanism by which the requestor's identity is retained and verified at each stage of the approval process, ensuring that the request is properly attributed to its originator.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Requestor | The individual or entity initiating an approval request. |
| Approval Request | A formal or informal ask for approval or validation of a particular action, decision, or transaction. |
| Identity Verification | The process of confirming the authenticity of a requestor's identity, often through authentication mechanisms or role-based access control. |
| Approval Workflow | A sequence of tasks, decisions, and actions involved in evaluating and responding to an approval request. |
| Audit Trail | A record of all events, including approval requests, decisions, and actions, that provides a clear history of the approval process. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts underlying Setting Requestor Identity in Approvals include:
- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of the requestor to ensure they are who they claim to be.
- **Authorization**: Ensuring the requestor has the necessary permissions or rights to initiate the approval request.
- **Auditability**: Maintaining a clear and transparent record of all approval requests and their associated requestor identities.
- **Compliance**: Adhering to organizational policies, regulatory requirements, and standards that govern approval processes and requestor identity management.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Setting Requestor Identity in Approvals typically involves the following steps:
1. **Requestor Authentication**: The requestor's identity is verified through a secure authentication process.
2. **Request Initiation**: The authenticated requestor initiates an approval request, which is then associated with their verified identity.
3. **Approval Workflow Execution**: The approval request is processed through a predefined workflow, during which the requestor's identity is retained and verified at each decision point.
4. **Audit Trail Maintenance**: A comprehensive record of the approval request, including the requestor's identity and all subsequent actions and decisions, is maintained for auditing and compliance purposes.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Setting Requestor Identity in Approvals include:
- **Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration**: Using SSO solutions to authenticate requestors and simplify the identity verification process.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implementing RBAC to authorize requestors based on their roles within the organization.
- **Automated Approval Workflows**: Utilizing workflow automation tools to streamline the approval process while maintaining the integrity of the requestor's identity.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Setting Requestor Identity in Approvals include:
- **Inadequate Authentication**: Failing to properly verify the requestor's identity, leading to potential security breaches and unauthorized requests.
- **Insufficient Audit Trails**: Not maintaining comprehensive records of approval requests and their associated identities, compromising accountability and compliance.
- **Manual Identity Management**: Relying on manual processes for managing requestor identities, which can be error-prone and inefficient.
