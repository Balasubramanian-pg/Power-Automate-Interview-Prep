> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 48. UX Benefits of Direct Source Buttons exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of Direct Source Buttons is to enhance user experience (UX) by providing a seamless and efficient way to access original sources of information, thereby addressing the problem of information fragmentation and disintermediation. This approach enables users to bypass intermediaries and directly engage with the source, promoting transparency, accuracy, and trust.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Direct Source Buttons represent a design pattern that streamlines the process of accessing primary sources, such as original research, data, or content creators. By integrating these buttons into user interfaces, designers can facilitate a more direct and unobstructed flow of information, ultimately leading to a more informed and empowered user base.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Direct Source | The original source of information, such as a research paper, dataset, or creator's website. |
| Button | A graphical user interface (GUI) element that, when clicked, performs a specific action, such as navigating to a Direct Source. |
| Disintermediation | The process of removing intermediaries, such as aggregators or curators, to access information directly from the source. |
| Information Fragmentation | The phenomenon of information being scattered across multiple sources, making it difficult for users to find and access relevant information. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts underlying Direct Source Buttons include:
* **Transparency**: Providing clear and direct access to original sources.
* **Efficiency**: Streamlining the process of accessing information.
* **Accuracy**: Ensuring that users receive accurate and unaltered information.
* **Trust**: Establishing trust between users and the source of information.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for implementing Direct Source Buttons involves:
1. Identifying relevant Direct Sources.
2. Designing intuitive and prominent buttons that clearly indicate the destination.
3. Ensuring seamless navigation to the Direct Source upon button click.
4. Providing context and metadata to facilitate user understanding.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Direct Source Buttons include:
* **Source attribution**: Clearly indicating the origin of the information.
* **Button placement**: Positioning buttons in a prominent and accessible location.
* **Contextualization**: Providing surrounding context to help users understand the relevance and significance of the Direct Source.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Direct Source Buttons include:
* **Obfuscation**: Hiding or obscuring the Direct Source.
* **Intermediation**: Inserting unnecessary intermediaries between the user and the Direct Source.
* **Misattribution**: Falsely or misleadingly attributing the source of information.
