> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 31. Use Cases for Any-Member Authorization exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Any-Member Authorization is designed to address the need for flexible and scalable access control mechanisms in distributed systems, where multiple members or entities require access to shared resources. The primary problem it solves is the complexity of managing access control lists (ACLs) and role-based access control (RBAC) in environments with a large number of users, groups, or services. By allowing any member to access a resource without requiring explicit permission or membership, Any-Member Authorization simplifies access management and reduces administrative overhead.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of Any-Member Authorization revolves around the idea of granting access to a resource based on a set of predefined rules, rather than relying on explicit user or group permissions. This approach enables a more dynamic and adaptive access control mechanism, where access decisions are made in real-time based on the attributes and properties of the requesting entity. The model consists of three primary components: the resource, the requesting entity, and the authorization policy.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Any-Member Authorization | An access control mechanism that grants access to a resource based on a set of predefined rules, without requiring explicit user or group permissions. |
| Resource | An entity or object that requires access control, such as a file, directory, or network service. |
| Requesting Entity | The user, group, or service requesting access to a resource. |
| Authorization Policy | A set of rules that define the conditions under which access to a resource is granted or denied. |
| Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) | An access control mechanism that grants access to a resource based on the attributes and properties of the requesting entity. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Any-Member Authorization include:
* **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Access decisions are made based on the attributes and properties of the requesting entity.
* **Policy-Based Access Control**: Access decisions are made based on a set of predefined rules and policies.
* **Dynamic Access Control**: Access decisions are made in real-time, based on the current state of the requesting entity and the resource.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Any-Member Authorization involves the following components:
* **Resource Server**: The entity responsible for protecting the resource and enforcing access control decisions.
* **Authorization Server**: The entity responsible for evaluating the authorization policy and making access decisions.
* **Requesting Entity**: The user, group, or service requesting access to the resource.
* **Authorization Policy**: The set of rules that define the conditions under which access to the resource is granted or denied.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Any-Member Authorization include:
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Using roles to define access permissions and simplify access management.
* **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Using attributes and properties to define access permissions and make access decisions.
* **Policy-Based Access Control**: Using policies to define access permissions and make access decisions.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Any-Member Authorization include:
* **Overly Permissive Access Control**: Granting excessive access permissions to users or groups, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.
* **Underly Restrictive Access Control**: Granting insufficient access permissions to users or groups, reducing productivity and efficiency.
* **Static Access Control**: Failing to update access control policies and permissions in response to changing requirements and conditions.
