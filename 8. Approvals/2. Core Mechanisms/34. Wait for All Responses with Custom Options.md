Canonical documentation for 34. Wait for All Responses with Custom Options. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 34. Wait for All Responses with Custom Options exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Wait for All Responses with Custom Options is to provide a mechanism for handling asynchronous operations that require waiting for multiple responses, with the ability to customize the waiting process. This addresses the problem of handling complex workflows that involve multiple concurrent tasks, where the completion of one task depends on the responses from other tasks. By waiting for all responses with custom options, developers can ensure that their application can handle these complex workflows efficiently and reliably.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of Wait for All Responses with Custom Options involves understanding the concept of asynchronous operations, callbacks, and promises. It also involves understanding the need for customizing the waiting process, such as setting timeouts, handling errors, and prioritizing responses. The mental model should include the idea of a waiting mechanism that can be configured to handle different types of responses, such as success, failure, and timeout.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Asynchronous Operation | An operation that is executed independently of the main program flow, allowing other tasks to be performed while waiting for the operation to complete. |
| Callback | A function that is passed as an argument to another function, to be executed when a specific operation is completed. |
| Promise | An object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value. |
| Custom Options | Configuration settings that allow developers to customize the waiting process, such as setting timeouts, handling errors, and prioritizing responses. |
| Response | The result of an asynchronous operation, which can be a success, failure, or timeout. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Wait for All Responses with Custom Options include:
* Asynchronous operations: The ability to execute multiple tasks concurrently, without blocking the main program flow.
* Callbacks and promises: Mechanisms for handling the completion of asynchronous operations, and retrieving their results.
* Customization: The ability to configure the waiting process to handle different types of responses, and to prioritize responses based on specific criteria.
* Error handling: The ability to handle errors that occur during the waiting process, such as timeouts, network errors, and application errors.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Wait for All Responses with Custom Options involves the following steps:
1. Initialize the waiting mechanism with custom options, such as setting timeouts and prioritizing responses.
2. Execute the asynchronous operations, and pass callbacks or promises to handle their completion.
3. Wait for all responses, using the configured waiting mechanism.
4. Handle the responses, using the callbacks or promises passed during the execution of the asynchronous operations.
5. Handle errors that occur during the waiting process, using the configured error handling mechanisms.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Wait for All Responses with Custom Options include:
* Using callbacks to handle the completion of asynchronous operations, and to retrieve their results.
* Using promises to handle the completion of asynchronous operations, and to retrieve their results.
* Setting timeouts to handle cases where the asynchronous operations take too long to complete.
* Prioritizing responses based on specific criteria, such as the type of response, or the priority of the task.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Wait for All Responses with Custom Options include:
* Using synchronous operations, which can block the main program flow, and prevent other tasks from being executed.
* Not handling errors that occur during the waiting process, which can cause the application to crash, or behave unexpectedly.
* Not customizing the waiting process, which can lead to inefficient handling of asynchronous operations, and poor performance.
* Not prioritizing responses, which can lead to delays in handling critical tasks, and poor user experience.
