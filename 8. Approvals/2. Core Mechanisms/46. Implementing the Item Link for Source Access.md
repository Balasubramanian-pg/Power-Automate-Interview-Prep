> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 46. Implementing the Item Link for Source Access exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Item Link for Source Access is a crucial component in various systems, enabling efficient and organized access to source materials. It addresses the problem of disorganized or inaccessible source data, which can lead to decreased productivity, increased errors, and compromised data integrity. By implementing the Item Link, users can establish a structured connection between items and their corresponding source materials, facilitating streamlined access and management.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Item Link for Source Access operates on the principle of creating a digital bridge between an item and its source material. This bridge, or link, enables users to access the source material directly from the item, eliminating the need for manual searching or navigation. The conceptual model consists of three primary components: the item, the source material, and the link itself. The item serves as the reference point, while the source material provides the underlying data or information. The link establishes the connection between the two, allowing for seamless access and interaction.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Item | A digital or physical entity that requires access to source material |
| Source Material | The underlying data, information, or content associated with an item |
| Item Link | A digital connection between an item and its source material |
| Source Access | The ability to access and interact with source material through an item link |
| Link Resolver | A system or service responsible for resolving item links and providing access to source material |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Item Link for Source Access include:
* **Item-Source Material Relationship**: The establishment of a connection between an item and its corresponding source material.
* **Link Creation**: The process of generating a digital link between an item and its source material.
* **Link Resolution**: The process of resolving an item link to provide access to the source material.
* **Access Control**: The management of permissions and restrictions for accessing source material through item links.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for implementing the Item Link for Source Access involves the following components and interactions:
1. **Item Registration**: Items are registered in a system or database, creating a unique identifier for each item.
2. **Source Material Repository**: Source materials are stored in a repository, which can be a database, file system, or other storage solution.
3. **Link Creation Service**: A service or system generates item links based on the registered items and their corresponding source materials.
4. **Link Resolver**: A link resolver system or service resolves item links, providing access to the source material.
5. **Access Control System**: An access control system manages permissions and restrictions for accessing source material through item links.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for implementing the Item Link for Source Access include:
* **Item-Level Linking**: Creating item links at the individual item level, allowing for granular access control and management.
* **Batch Linking**: Creating item links in bulk, streamlining the process for large collections of items.
* **Automated Link Resolution**: Using automated systems or services to resolve item links, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for implementing the Item Link for Source Access include:
* **Manual Link Creation**: Manually creating item links, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors.
* **Unsecured Link Storage**: Storing item links in an unsecured manner, compromising the integrity and security of the source material.
* **Insufficient Access Control**: Failing to implement adequate access control measures, allowing unauthorized access to source material.
