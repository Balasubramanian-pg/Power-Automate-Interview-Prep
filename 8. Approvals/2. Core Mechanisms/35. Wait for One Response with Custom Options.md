# 35. Wait for One Response with Custom Options

Canonical documentation for 35. Wait for One Response with Custom Options. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 35. Wait for One Response with Custom Options exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Wait for One Response with Custom Options is to provide a mechanism for handling asynchronous responses in a flexible and customizable manner. This functionality addresses the problem of needing to wait for a single response from a set of possible responses, where the waiting process requires specific options or configurations to be applied. The class of problems it addresses includes scenarios where an application needs to pause its execution until it receives a specific response, and this response needs to be processed according to particular rules or settings defined by custom options.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
At a high level, Wait for One Response with Custom Options involves setting up a listener or a callback that waits for incoming responses. Once a response is received, it is evaluated against a set of predefined criteria or options. If the response matches the expected criteria, it is processed accordingly. This process allows for the customization of how responses are handled, enabling applications to adapt to different scenarios or requirements.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Asynchronous Response | A response that is not immediately available when requested, requiring the application to wait or poll for its availability. |
| Custom Options | Settings or configurations that can be applied to the waiting process to customize how responses are evaluated and processed. |
| Listener | A component or function that waits for incoming responses. |
| Response Criteria | The predefined rules or conditions that a response must meet to be considered valid or relevant. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Wait for One Response with Custom Options include:
- **Asynchronous Programming**: The ability of an application to execute other tasks while waiting for a response.
- **Customization**: The capability to modify or extend the behavior of the waiting process through custom options.
- **Response Handling**: The process of evaluating and processing incoming responses based on predefined criteria.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Wait for One Response with Custom Options typically involves the following steps:
1. **Setup**: Configuring the listener with the necessary custom options.
2. **Waiting**: The listener waits for an incoming response.
3. **Evaluation**: The received response is evaluated against the predefined response criteria.
4. **Processing**: If the response matches the criteria, it is processed according to the custom options.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns include:
- **Timeouts**: Implementing a timeout mechanism to handle scenarios where a response is not received within a specified timeframe.
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Setting up retry logic to handle transient failures or errors in receiving or processing responses.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns include:
- **Busy Waiting**: Continuously polling for a response without implementing an efficient waiting mechanism, leading to resource waste.
- **Hardcoding**: Using hardcoded values for custom options instead of making them configurable, reducing flexibility.
