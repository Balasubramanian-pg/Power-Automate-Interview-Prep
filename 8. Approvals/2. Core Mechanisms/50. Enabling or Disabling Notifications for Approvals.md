## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 50. Enabling or Disabling Notifications for Approvals exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of enabling or disabling notifications for approvals is to provide users with control over the notifications they receive regarding approval requests, updates, and decisions.
