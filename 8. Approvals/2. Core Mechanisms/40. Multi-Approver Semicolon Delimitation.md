Canonical documentation for 40. Multi-Approver Semicolon Delimitation. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 40. Multi-Approver Semicolon Delimitation exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Multi-Approver Semicolon Delimitation exists to facilitate the efficient and organized management of multiple approvers in various business processes, such as document approval, workflow management, and access control. The class of problems it addresses includes the need for a standardized method of separating and processing multiple approver names, roles, or identifiers, ensuring that each approver is uniquely identified and notified accordingly.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Multi-Approver Semicolon Delimitation concept revolves around the use of semicolons (;) as a delimiter to separate multiple approver values in a single string or field. This approach enables the storage and processing of multiple approvers in a compact and efficient manner, while maintaining the ability to parse and extract individual approver information as needed.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approver | An individual or entity responsible for reviewing and approving a particular document, process, or request. |
| Delimiter | A character or symbol used to separate multiple values or elements in a single string or field. |
| Semicolon Delimitation | The use of semicolons (;) as a delimiter to separate multiple approver values. |
| Multi-Approver | A scenario involving multiple approvers, each with their own unique identifier, role, or responsibility. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Multi-Approver Semicolon Delimitation include:
* The use of semicolons as a delimiter to separate multiple approver values
* The ability to store and process multiple approver values in a single string or field
* The importance of unique identification and parsing of individual approver information
* The need for standardized formatting and syntax to ensure consistency and compatibility across different systems and applications

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Multi-Approver Semicolon Delimitation involves the use of semicolons to separate multiple approver values, with each value consisting of a unique identifier, role, or name. The recommended syntax includes:
* Using semicolons (;) as the delimiter
* Enclosing each approver value in quotes (") if it contains special characters or spaces
* Separating multiple approver values with a single semicolon (;) and no trailing semicolon

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Multi-Approver Semicolon Delimitation include:
* Using a single string or field to store multiple approver values
* Implementing parsing and extraction logic to retrieve individual approver information
* Utilizing standardized formatting and syntax to ensure consistency and compatibility
* Integrating with existing workflow management and access control systems

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Multi-Approver Semicolon Delimitation include:
* Using inconsistent or proprietary delimiters
* Failing to implement proper parsing and extraction logic
* Ignoring standardized formatting and syntax
* Storing multiple approver values in separate fields or tables
