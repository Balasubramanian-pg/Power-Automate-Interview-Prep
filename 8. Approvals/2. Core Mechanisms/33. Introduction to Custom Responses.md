# 33. Introduction to Custom Responses

Canonical documentation for 33. Introduction to Custom Responses. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 33. Introduction to Custom Responses exists and the class of problems it addresses. The purpose of custom responses is to provide a flexible and extensible way to handle various scenarios and edge cases in software applications, allowing developers to tailor their responses to specific needs and requirements. The problem space includes the limitations of standard, out-of-the-box responses, which may not be sufficient to handle complex or unique situations.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic. Custom responses can be thought of as a modular and configurable framework that enables developers to define and manage their own response logic, decoupling it from the underlying application code. This framework typically consists of a set of predefined response templates, a rules engine, and an API for integrating with external systems.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Custom Response | A tailored response to a specific scenario or edge case, defined and managed by the developer |
| Response Template | A predefined template for generating responses, which can be customized and extended |
| Rules Engine | A component that evaluates conditions and applies rules to determine the appropriate response |
| Response API | An interface for integrating custom responses with external systems and applications |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic. The core concepts of custom responses include:
* **Modularity**: Custom responses are designed to be modular and self-contained, allowing for easy integration and reuse.
* **Configurability**: Custom responses can be tailored to specific needs and requirements through configuration and customization.
* **Extensibility**: Custom responses can be extended and modified through the use of APIs, plugins, and other extension mechanisms.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model. The standard model for custom responses typically involves the following components:
* **Response Definition**: A clear and concise definition of the response, including its purpose, scope, and requirements.
* **Response Template**: A predefined template for generating the response, which can be customized and extended.
* **Rules Engine**: A component that evaluates conditions and applies rules to determine the appropriate response.
* **Integration API**: An interface for integrating the custom response with external systems and applications.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns. Common patterns for custom responses include:
* **Error Handling**: Custom responses for handling errors and exceptions, such as error messages, retry mechanisms, and fallback strategies.
* **Validation**: Custom responses for validating user input, such as validation rules, error messages, and feedback mechanisms.
* **Personalization**: Custom responses for personalizing the user experience, such as tailored content, recommendations, and offers.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices. Anti-patterns for custom responses include:
* **Over-Engineering**: Creating overly complex and customized responses that are difficult to maintain and extend.
* **Tight Coupling**: Tightly coupling custom responses to specific application code or infrastructure, making it difficult to integrate with other systems.
* **Lack of Standardization**: Failing to standardize custom responses, leading to inconsistencies and difficulties in maintenance and support.
