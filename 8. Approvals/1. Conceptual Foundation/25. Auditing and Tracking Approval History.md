> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 25. Auditing and Tracking Approval History exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of auditing and tracking approval history is to provide a transparent and accountable record of all approval processes, ensuring that decisions are made with integrity and can be traced back to the responsible individuals. This addresses the problem of lack of visibility, accountability, and trust in approval processes, which can lead to errors, miscommunication, and potential security breaches.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Auditing and tracking approval history involves capturing and storing information about all approval-related events, including requests, approvals, rejections, and changes. This information is then used to generate a chronological record of all approval activities, providing a clear audit trail that can be used for compliance, security, and operational purposes.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approval | The act of granting permission or consent for a request or action. |
| Audit Trail | A chronological record of all approval-related events, including requests, approvals, rejections, and changes. |
| Compliance | The state of adhering to relevant laws, regulations, and standards. |
| Approval History | A record of all approval-related events, including requests, approvals, rejections, and changes, used to track and analyze approval processes. |
| Transparency | The quality of being open and honest in all approval-related activities, providing clear visibility into decision-making processes. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of auditing and tracking approval history include:
* **Immutability**: Ensuring that approval records are tamper-proof and cannot be altered or deleted.
* **Versioning**: Maintaining a record of all changes made to approval requests and decisions.
* **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of individuals involved in approval processes.
* **Authorization**: Controlling access to approval processes and ensuring that only authorized individuals can make decisions.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for auditing and tracking approval history involves the following components:
* **Approval Request**: A formal request for approval, including relevant information and context.
* **Approval Decision**: A decision made by an authorized individual, either approving or rejecting the request.
* **Audit Trail**: A chronological record of all approval-related events, including requests, approvals, rejections, and changes.
* **Compliance Checking**: Regular reviews of approval processes to ensure compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and standards.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in auditing and tracking approval history include:
* **Serial Approval**: A linear approval process, where each approval decision is made sequentially.
* **Parallel Approval**: A concurrent approval process, where multiple approval decisions are made simultaneously.
* **Escalation**: A process for escalating approval requests to higher-level authorities when necessary.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in auditing and tracking approval history include:
* **Lack of Transparency**: Failing to provide clear visibility into approval processes and decision-making.
* **Inconsistent Approval Processes**: Using different approval processes for similar requests, leading to confusion and errors.
* **Insufficient Audit Trails**: Failing to maintain accurate and complete records of approval-related events.
