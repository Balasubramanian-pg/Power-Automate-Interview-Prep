Canonical documentation for 19. Signaling the Flow to Resume. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 19. Signaling the Flow to Resume exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of signaling the flow to resume is to notify a suspended process or thread that it can continue execution, typically after a specific condition or event has occurred. This mechanism addresses the problem of efficiently managing concurrent processes, ensuring that resources are utilized effectively, and preventing deadlocks or starvation. By signaling the flow to resume, systems can handle complex workflows, prioritize tasks, and maintain responsiveness.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Signaling the flow to resume involves a producer-consumer relationship, where one entity (the producer) generates a signal that notifies another entity (the consumer) to resume its execution. This signal can be generated in response to various events, such as the availability of resources, completion of a task, or changes in the system state. The consumer, upon receiving the signal, can then proceed with its execution, potentially leading to further signals or events that propagate through the system.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Signal | A notification or event that triggers a specific action or response. |
| Flow | A sequence of execution or a process that can be suspended or resumed. |
| Resume | To restart or continue execution from a previously suspended state. |
| Suspend | To temporarily halt or pause execution, pending a specific condition or event. |
| Producer | An entity that generates a signal or event that triggers a response. |
| Consumer | An entity that receives a signal or event and responds accordingly. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of signaling the flow to resume include:
* **Asynchronous execution**: The ability of processes or threads to execute independently, with signals or events used to coordinate their actions.
* **Conditional synchronization**: The use of signals or events to synchronize the execution of processes or threads, based on specific conditions or states.
* **Notification mechanisms**: The methods or protocols used to generate and propagate signals or events, such as interrupts, callbacks, or message passing.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for signaling the flow to resume involves a callback or notification mechanism, where the producer generates a signal that triggers a callback function or handler in the consumer. This callback function can then resume the execution of the consumer, potentially passing parameters or data as needed. The model typically involves the following steps:
1. The producer generates a signal or event.
2. The signal is propagated to the consumer.
3. The consumer receives the signal and invokes a callback function.
4. The callback function resumes the execution of the consumer.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for signaling the flow to resume include:
* **Polling**: The consumer periodically checks for signals or events, allowing it to resume execution when a specific condition is met.
* **Interrupt-driven**: The producer generates an interrupt that triggers a callback function in the consumer, allowing it to resume execution.
* **Message passing**: The producer sends a message or signal to the consumer, which can then resume execution based on the contents of the message.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for signaling the flow to resume include:
* **Busy-waiting**: The consumer continuously polls for signals or events, wasting resources and potentially leading to starvation or priority inversion.
* **Unconditional synchronization**: The consumer is synchronized without considering the specific condition or state, potentially leading to unnecessary delays or deadlocks.
