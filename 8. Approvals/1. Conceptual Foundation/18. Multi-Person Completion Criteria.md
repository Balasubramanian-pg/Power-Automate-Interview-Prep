> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 18. Multi-Person Completion Criteria exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Multi-Person Completion Criteria exists to provide a standardized framework for evaluating the completion of tasks, projects, or processes that involve multiple individuals or stakeholders. This framework addresses the class of problems related to collaboration, communication, and coordination among team members, ensuring that all parties are aligned and working towards a common goal. The primary problem space includes challenges such as defining clear completion criteria, establishing effective communication channels, and ensuring that all stakeholders are held accountable for their contributions.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Multi-Person Completion Criteria can be conceptualized as a hierarchical framework consisting of three primary layers: (1) task definition, (2) role-based responsibilities, and (3) completion evaluation. The task definition layer outlines the specific objectives, deliverables, and timelines for the project or task. The role-based responsibilities layer assigns specific tasks, duties, and expectations to each team member or stakeholder. The completion evaluation layer assesses the progress, quality, and completeness of the work based on predefined criteria, ensuring that all stakeholders are held accountable for their contributions.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Completion Criteria | A set of predefined standards, metrics, or requirements used to evaluate the completeness and quality of a task, project, or process. |
| Multi-Person Task | A task, project, or process that involves multiple individuals or stakeholders working collaboratively to achieve a common goal. |
| Role-Based Responsibilities | A clear definition of the tasks, duties, and expectations assigned to each team member or stakeholder. |
| Stakeholder | An individual or group with a vested interest in the outcome of a task, project, or process. |
| Task Definition | A clear and concise outline of the specific objectives, deliverables, and timelines for a task, project, or process. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Multi-Person Completion Criteria include: (1) clear task definition, (2) role-based responsibilities, (3) effective communication, (4) collaborative work environment, and (5) continuous evaluation and feedback. These concepts are interconnected and interdependent, ensuring that all stakeholders are aligned and working towards a common goal.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Multi-Person Completion Criteria involves the following steps: (1) task definition and planning, (2) role-based responsibility assignment, (3) establishment of communication channels, (4) collaborative work and progress tracking, and (5) completion evaluation and feedback. This model provides a structured approach to managing multi-person tasks, ensuring that all stakeholders are held accountable for their contributions and that the project or task is completed to the required standards.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Multi-Person Completion Criteria include: (1) regular progress meetings, (2) collaborative project management tools, (3) clear and concise communication, (4) defined escalation procedures, and (5) continuous feedback and evaluation. These patterns help to ensure that all stakeholders are aligned and working towards a common goal, and that any issues or challenges are addressed promptly and effectively.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Multi-Person Completion Criteria include: (1) poor communication, (2) lack of clear task definition, (3) inadequate role-based responsibility assignment, (4) insufficient feedback and evaluation, and (5) inadequate escalation procedures. These anti-patterns can lead to confusion, misalignment, and delays, ultimately resulting in a failed or incomplete project or task.
