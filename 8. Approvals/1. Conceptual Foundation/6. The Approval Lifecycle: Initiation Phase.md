# 6. The Approval Lifecycle: Initiation Phase

Canonical documentation for 6. The Approval Lifecycle: Initiation Phase. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 6. The Approval Lifecycle: Initiation Phase exists and the class of problems it addresses. The Approval Lifecycle: Initiation Phase is a critical component of organizational governance, ensuring that all proposals, projects, or changes are properly assessed, approved, and initiated. This phase addresses the problems of uncontrolled changes, lack of transparency, and inadequate risk assessment, which can lead to project failures, financial losses, and reputational damage.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic. The Approval Lifecycle: Initiation Phase is the first stage of the approval lifecycle, where a proposal or project is submitted, reviewed, and approved or rejected. This phase involves the identification of the need for a change, the development of a proposal, and the submission of the proposal for approval. The initiation phase sets the foundation for the entire approval lifecycle, ensuring that all subsequent phases are properly aligned and executed.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approval | The formal authorization to proceed with a proposal or project. |
| Initiation Phase | The first stage of the approval lifecycle, where a proposal or project is submitted, reviewed, and approved or rejected. |
| Proposal | A formal document outlining a proposed change, project, or initiative. |
| Stakeholder | An individual or group with an interest or concern in the proposal or project. |
| Governance | The framework of rules, policies, and procedures that guide the approval lifecycle. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic. The core concepts of the Approval Lifecycle: Initiation Phase include:
* **Proposal Development**: The process of creating a formal proposal outlining the proposed change, project, or initiative.
* **Stakeholder Identification**: The process of identifying individuals or groups with an interest or concern in the proposal or project.
* **Risk Assessment**: The process of evaluating the potential risks and benefits associated with the proposal or project.
* **Approval Criteria**: The established standards and guidelines used to evaluate and approve or reject proposals.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model. The standard model for the Approval Lifecycle: Initiation Phase involves the following steps:
1. Proposal development and submission
2. Stakeholder identification and notification
3. Review and evaluation of the proposal
4. Risk assessment and mitigation
5. Approval or rejection of the proposal

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns. Common patterns in the Approval Lifecycle: Initiation Phase include:
* **Gate Review**: A formal review and evaluation of the proposal at specific milestones or gates.
* **Stakeholder Engagement**: The process of engaging stakeholders throughout the initiation phase to ensure their concerns and interests are addressed.
* **Risk-Based Approval**: The process of evaluating and approving proposals based on their potential risks and benefits.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices. Anti-patterns in the Approval Lifecycle: Initiation Phase include:
* **Lack of Transparency**: Failing to provide clear and timely information to stakeholders.
* **Inadequate Risk Assessment**: Failing to properly evaluate and mitigate potential risks.
* **Insufficient Stakeholder Engagement**: Failing to engage stakeholders throughout the initiation phase.
