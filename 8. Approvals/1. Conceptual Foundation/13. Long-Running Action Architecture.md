# 13. Long-Running Action Architecture

Canonical documentation for 13. Long-Running Action Architecture. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 13. Long-Running Action Architecture exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Long-Running Action Architecture exists to provide a framework for managing actions that take an extended period to complete, such as asynchronous operations, batch processing, or workflow execution. This architecture addresses the class of problems related to handling concurrent, time-consuming tasks while ensuring reliability, scalability, and maintainability. It provides a structured approach to designing systems that can efficiently handle long-running actions, minimizing the impact on system resources and user experience.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Long-Running Action Architecture is based on a decoupled, event-driven model, where actions are triggered by external events or user requests. The architecture consists of three primary components: the Action Initiator, the Action Processor, and the Action Monitor. The Action Initiator receives and validates incoming requests, the Action Processor executes the long-running action, and the Action Monitor tracks the progress and status of the action. This decoupling enables the system to handle multiple actions concurrently, improving overall throughput and responsiveness.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Action | A self-contained, executable unit of work that performs a specific task or set of tasks. |
| Action Initiator | The component responsible for receiving and validating incoming requests for long-running actions. |
| Action Processor | The component that executes the long-running action, which may involve multiple steps or sub-actions. |
| Action Monitor | The component that tracks the progress and status of long-running actions, providing real-time updates and notifications. |
| Asynchronous Operation | An operation that is executed independently of the main program flow, allowing the system to continue processing other requests. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The Long-Running Action Architecture is built around several core concepts:
* **Decoupling**: Separating the Action Initiator, Action Processor, and Action Monitor to enable concurrent execution and improve system scalability.
* **Event-Driven**: Using events to trigger actions, allowing the system to respond to changing conditions and user requests.
* **Asynchronous Processing**: Executing long-running actions independently of the main program flow to minimize blocking and improve system responsiveness.
* **Monitoring and Feedback**: Providing real-time updates and notifications to ensure transparency and visibility into the status of long-running actions.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Long-Running Action Architecture consists of the following components and interactions:
1. The Action Initiator receives an incoming request and validates the input parameters.
2. The Action Initiator triggers the Action Processor to execute the long-running action.
3. The Action Processor executes the action, which may involve multiple steps or sub-actions.
4. The Action Monitor tracks the progress and status of the action, providing real-time updates and notifications.
5. The Action Monitor notifies the Action Initiator of the action's completion, which may trigger additional processing or notifications.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Long-Running Action Architecture include:
* **Request-Response**: The Action Initiator receives a request, triggers the Action Processor, and returns a response to the client.
* **Publish-Subscribe**: The Action Initiator publishes an event, which is subscribed to by the Action Processor, triggering the execution of the long-running action.
* **Polling**: The Action Monitor periodically polls the Action Processor for updates on the status of the long-running action.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Long-Running Action Architecture include:
* **Tight Coupling**: Coupling the Action Initiator, Action Processor, and Action Monitor too closely, limiting the system's ability to scale and respond to changing conditions.
* **Synchronous Processing**: Executing long-running actions synchronously, blocking the main program flow and limiting system responsiveness.
* **Lack of Monitoring**: Failing to provide real-time updates and notifications, reducing transparency and visibility into the status of long-running actions.
