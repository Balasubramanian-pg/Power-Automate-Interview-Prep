Canonical documentation for 5. Integration with Outlook Actionable Messages. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 5. Integration with Outlook Actionable Messages exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of integrating with Outlook Actionable Messages is to enable users to take actions directly from within their email inbox, streamlining workflows, and increasing productivity. This integration addresses the problem of information fragmentation, where users have to navigate between multiple applications to complete tasks, and the issue of context switching, which can lead to decreased efficiency and increased errors.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Outlook Actionable Messages allow developers to create interactive, actionable content within emails, enabling users to perform tasks without leaving their inbox. This is achieved through the use of adaptive cards, which are JSON-based payloads that define the structure and layout of the actionable content. The integration with Outlook Actionable Messages involves designing, developing, and deploying these adaptive cards to create seamless, in-context user experiences.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Actionable Message | An email that contains interactive content, allowing users to perform tasks directly from their inbox. |
| Adaptive Card | A JSON-based payload that defines the structure and layout of the actionable content within an email. |
| Card Action | A specific action that can be performed from within an adaptive card, such as responding to a survey or approving a request. |
| Action URL | A URL that is invoked when a user interacts with a card action, triggering a specific action or workflow. |
| Provider | An application or service that generates and sends actionable messages to users. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of integrating with Outlook Actionable Messages include:
* **Actionable content**: Creating interactive, task-oriented content that enables users to perform actions directly from their inbox.
* **Adaptive card design**: Designing and developing adaptive cards that are visually appealing, intuitive, and optimized for user engagement.
* **Card action handling**: Implementing the logic and workflows that handle user interactions with card actions, ensuring seamless and secure execution of tasks.
* **Security and authentication**: Ensuring the secure transmission and processing of actionable messages, including authentication and authorization of users and providers.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for integrating with Outlook Actionable Messages involves the following components and workflows:
* **Provider registration**: Registering the provider application or service with Microsoft, obtaining the necessary credentials and configuration settings.
* **Adaptive card design and development**: Designing and developing adaptive cards that conform to the Outlook Actionable Messages specification.
* **Actionable message creation and sending**: Creating and sending actionable messages that contain the adaptive cards, using the registered provider credentials and configuration settings.
* **Card action handling and workflow execution**: Handling user interactions with card actions, executing the corresponding workflows and tasks, and providing feedback to the user.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for integrating with Outlook Actionable Messages include:
* **Approval workflows**: Using actionable messages to request approvals or reviews from users, with card actions that enable users to approve or reject requests.
* **Survey and feedback collection**: Using actionable messages to collect feedback or survey responses from users, with card actions that enable users to respond or provide input.
* **Task assignment and management**: Using actionable messages to assign tasks or manage workflows, with card actions that enable users to accept or decline tasks.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for integrating with Outlook Actionable Messages include:
* **Overly complex or cluttered adaptive cards**: Creating adaptive cards that are too complex or cluttered, leading to user confusion and decreased engagement.
* **Insufficient security or authentication**: Failing to implement adequate security or authentication measures, compromising the integrity and confidentiality of actionable messages.
* **Lack of feedback or follow-up**: Failing to provide timely and relevant feedback to users, or neglecting to follow up on user interactions and card actions.
