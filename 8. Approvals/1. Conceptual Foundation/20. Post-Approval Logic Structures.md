# 20. Post-Approval Logic Structures

Canonical documentation for 20. Post-Approval Logic Structures. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 20. Post-Approval Logic Structures exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Post-Approval Logic Structures exist to provide a standardized framework for managing and executing business logic after an approval process has been completed. This addresses the class of problems related to ensuring that approved requests, transactions, or workflows are properly handled, routed, and executed in a consistent and predictable manner. The primary problems addressed by Post-Approval Logic Structures include: 
- Inconsistent execution of approved requests
- Lack of transparency and visibility into post-approval workflows
- Inefficient routing and handling of approved transactions
- Insufficient auditing and logging of post-approval activities

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Post-Approval Logic Structures can be conceptualized as a series of conditional statements, decision tables, and workflow rules that are triggered after an approval process has been completed. This logic is designed to evaluate the approved request, transaction, or workflow and determine the next course of action, which may include routing to additional approvers, triggering notifications, or executing specific business processes.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approval Threshold | The minimum number of approvals required for a request or transaction to be considered approved |
| Post-Approval Workflow | A series of automated or manual tasks that are executed after an approval process has been completed |
| Decision Table | A table-based representation of business logic that defines the conditions and actions for a given scenario |
| Conditional Statement | A logical statement that evaluates a condition and executes a specific action based on the outcome |
| Routing Rule | A rule that determines the next destination or recipient of an approved request or transaction |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Post-Approval Logic Structures include:
- **Conditional Logic**: The use of conditional statements to evaluate approved requests and determine the next course of action
- **Decision Tables**: The use of table-based representations to define business logic and routing rules
- **Workflow Automation**: The use of automated workflows to execute business processes and tasks after approval
- **Auditing and Logging**: The capture and storage of post-approval activities for transparency and compliance

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Post-Approval Logic Structures typically includes the following components:
- **Approval Process**: The initial approval process that evaluates and approves requests or transactions
- **Post-Approval Evaluation**: The evaluation of the approved request or transaction to determine the next course of action
- **Decision Table or Conditional Statement**: The use of decision tables or conditional statements to define the business logic and routing rules
- **Workflow Automation**: The execution of automated workflows to handle approved requests or transactions
- **Auditing and Logging**: The capture and storage of post-approval activities for transparency and compliance

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Post-Approval Logic Structures include:
- **Simple Approval**: A single-level approval process with a straightforward post-approval workflow
- **Multi-Level Approval**: A multi-level approval process with conditional logic and routing rules
- **Parallel Approval**: A parallel approval process with multiple approvers and conditional logic
- **Escalation Workflow**: A workflow that escalates approved requests or transactions to additional approvers or stakeholders

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Post-Approval Logic Structures include:
- **Hardcoded Logic**: The use of hardcoded logic that is difficult to maintain and update
- **Inconsistent Routing**: Inconsistent routing of approved requests or transactions
- **Lack of Auditing**: The failure to capture and store post-approval activities for transparency and compliance
- **Overly Complex Workflows**: The use of overly complex workflows that are difficult to understand and maintain
