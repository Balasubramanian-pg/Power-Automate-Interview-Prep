Canonical documentation for 3. The Role of the Approvals Subsystem. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 3. The Role of the Approvals Subsystem exists and the class of problems it addresses. The Approvals Subsystem is designed to manage and facilitate the approval process for various business operations, ensuring that all necessary stakeholders review and validate critical decisions. This subsystem addresses the need for a structured and auditable approval workflow, reducing the risk of unauthorized or unapproved actions.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic. The Approvals Subsystem operates as a centralized hub, integrating with multiple business systems to provide a unified approval framework. It enables the creation, assignment, and tracking of approval requests, ensuring that all relevant stakeholders are notified and involved in the decision-making process.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approval Request | A formal request for approval, typically initiated by a user or system, which requires review and validation by authorized stakeholders. |
| Approver | An individual or group responsible for reviewing and making decisions on approval requests. |
| Approval Workflow | A predefined sequence of steps and stakeholders involved in the approval process. |
| Electronic Signature | A digital equivalent of a handwritten signature, used to authenticate and validate approval decisions. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic. The Approvals Subsystem relies on the following core concepts:
* **Separation of Duties**: Ensuring that no single individual has unrestricted control over the approval process.
* **Audit Trail**: Maintaining a record of all approval requests, decisions, and stakeholder involvement.
* **Workflow Automation**: Streamlining the approval process through automated notifications, assignments, and escalations.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model. The standard model for the Approvals Subsystem involves the following components:
* **Approval Request Initiation**: Users or systems initiate approval requests, providing relevant context and supporting documentation.
* **Approval Workflow Execution**: The Approvals Subsystem assigns and routes approval requests to designated stakeholders, following a predefined workflow.
* **Approval Decision**: Approvers review and make decisions on approval requests, which are then recorded and updated in the system.
* **Notification and Escalation**: The system notifies stakeholders of approval decisions and escalates requests as needed, ensuring timely and informed decision-making.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns. Common patterns in the Approvals Subsystem include:
* **Serial Approval**: A linear approval workflow, where each stakeholder reviews and approves a request in sequence.
* **Parallel Approval**: A concurrent approval workflow, where multiple stakeholders review and approve a request simultaneously.
* **Hybrid Approval**: A combination of serial and parallel approval workflows, tailored to specific business requirements.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices. Anti-patterns in the Approvals Subsystem include:
* **Manual Approval Processes**: Relying on manual, ad-hoc approval processes, which can lead to errors, delays, and lack of auditability.
* **Insufficient Stakeholder Involvement**: Failing to involve all necessary stakeholders in the approval process, potentially resulting in uninformed or unauthorized decisions.
* **Inadequate Audit Trails**: Neglecting to maintain comprehensive and accurate records of approval requests, decisions, and stakeholder involvement.
