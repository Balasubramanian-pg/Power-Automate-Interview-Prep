# 10. The Adaptive Card Experience in Teams

Canonical documentation for 10. The Adaptive Card Experience in Teams. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 10. The Adaptive Card Experience in Teams exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Adaptive Card Experience in Microsoft Teams is designed to provide a flexible and standardized way to present complex, interactive content within the Teams platform. It addresses the need for a consistent user experience across various applications and services integrated into Teams, enabling developers to create custom, interactive cards that can be easily shared and consumed within the Teams environment.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Adaptive Card Experience in Teams is based on the concept of adaptive cards, which are JSON-based payloads that contain a combination of text, images, and actions. These cards can be rendered in various contexts within Teams, such as chat windows, channels, and tabs, and can be used to display a wide range of content, from simple notifications to complex, interactive interfaces.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Adaptive Card | A JSON-based payload that contains a combination of text, images, and actions, used to present complex, interactive content within Teams. |
| Card Action | A specific action that can be performed on an adaptive card, such as opening a URL or sending a message. |
| Card Element | A basic building block of an adaptive card, such as a text block, image, or input field. |
| Host App | The application that renders and interacts with adaptive cards, such as Microsoft Teams. |
| Payload | The JSON-based data that defines the structure and content of an adaptive card. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Adaptive Card Experience in Teams include:
* **Declarative syntax**: Adaptive cards are defined using a declarative syntax, which describes the structure and content of the card.
* **Separation of concerns**: The adaptive card payload is separate from the rendering and interaction logic, allowing for a clear separation of concerns between the card author and the host app.
* **Extensibility**: Adaptive cards can be extended with custom elements and actions, allowing developers to create unique and tailored experiences.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the Adaptive Card Experience in Teams involves the following components:
* **Card author**: The entity responsible for creating and defining the adaptive card payload.
* **Host app**: The application that renders and interacts with the adaptive card, such as Microsoft Teams.
* **Card renderer**: The component responsible for rendering the adaptive card within the host app.
* **Interaction handler**: The component responsible for handling user interactions with the adaptive card.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for the Adaptive Card Experience in Teams include:
* **Notification cards**: Adaptive cards used to display notifications or alerts to users.
* **Input forms**: Adaptive cards used to collect user input, such as surveys or feedback forms.
* **Interactive dashboards**: Adaptive cards used to display interactive, data-driven dashboards or reports.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for the Adaptive Card Experience in Teams include:
* **Overly complex cards**: Adaptive cards that are too complex or dense, leading to a poor user experience.
* **Insufficient testing**: Failing to test adaptive cards thoroughly, leading to errors or inconsistencies.
* **Ignoring accessibility guidelines**: Failing to follow accessibility guidelines, leading to adaptive cards that are not usable by all users.
