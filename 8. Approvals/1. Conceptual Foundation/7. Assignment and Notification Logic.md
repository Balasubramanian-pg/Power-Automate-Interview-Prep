Canonical documentation for 7. Assignment and Notification Logic. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 7. Assignment and Notification Logic exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Assignment and Notification Logic exists to provide a standardized framework for managing the allocation of tasks, resources, and responsibilities within complex systems. It addresses the class of problems related to efficient task distribution, notification, and escalation, ensuring that the right individuals or entities are informed and engaged at the right time. This logic is crucial in various domains, including workflow management, incident response, and project management, where clear assignment and notification processes are essential for productivity, accountability, and compliance.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
At its core, Assignment and Notification Logic involves a set of rules, conditions, and actions that govern how tasks or notifications are assigned to and escalated among individuals or groups. This logic considers factors such as role, availability, priority, and expertise to ensure that assignments are made efficiently and effectively. It also encompasses the notification mechanisms that inform stakeholders about new assignments, changes in status, or impending deadlines, facilitating timely responses and minimizing delays.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Assignment | The act of allocating a task or responsibility to an individual or group. |
| Notification | The process of informing stakeholders about an event, change, or update. |
| Escalation | The transfer of a task or issue to a higher level of authority or expertise when it cannot be resolved at the current level. |
| Role | A defined set of responsibilities and privileges within a system or organization. |
| Availability | The state of being ready and capable to perform a task or respond to a notification. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Assignment and Notification Logic include:
- **Assignment Rules**: These are the predefined conditions that determine how tasks are allocated to individuals or groups based on factors like role, expertise, and availability.
- **Notification Triggers**: These are the events or changes that initiate notifications to stakeholders, such as assignment of a new task, update in task status, or approaching deadline.
- **Escalation Procedures**: These outline the steps and criteria for transferring tasks or issues to higher levels of authority or expertise when necessary.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Assignment and Notification Logic typically involves the following components:
1. **Task Definition**: Clearly defining the task, including its objectives, requirements, and deadlines.
2. **Assignment Engine**: A mechanism that applies assignment rules to allocate tasks to the appropriate individuals or groups.
3. **Notification Service**: A system that sends notifications to stakeholders based on predefined triggers and templates.
4. **Escalation Path**: A predefined hierarchy or process for escalating tasks or issues that cannot be resolved at the current level.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Assignment and Notification Logic include:
- **Round-Robin Assignment**: Tasks are assigned to team members in a cyclical manner to distribute workload evenly.
- **Priority-Based Escalation**: Issues are escalated based on their priority level, with higher priority issues being addressed first.
- **Time-Based Notification**: Notifications are sent at specific times or intervals, such as daily summaries or weekly updates.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns to avoid in Assignment and Notification Logic include:
- **Over-Notification**: Sending too many notifications, leading to information overload and decreased responsiveness.
- **Inconsistent Assignment**: Failing to apply consistent assignment rules, resulting in unfair workload distribution or confusion.
- **Lack of Transparency**: Not providing clear information about assignment and escalation processes, leading to mistrust and inefficiency.
