# 2. Evolution: From Email Options to First-Class Approvals

Canonical documentation for 2. Evolution: From Email Options to First-Class Approvals. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 2. Evolution: From Email Options to First-Class Approvals exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The evolution from email options to first-class approvals addresses the need for more efficient, transparent, and automated approval processes. Traditional email-based approval systems often result in lost or overlooked requests, delayed responses, and a general lack of visibility into the approval status. This evolution aims to streamline approval workflows, reduce manual errors, and increase productivity by integrating approvals as a native, first-class component of business processes.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of evolving from email options to first-class approvals involves recognizing approvals as a critical business process that deserves dedicated, integrated solutions. This model encompasses the transition from manual, email-based approval requests to automated, system-integrated approval workflows. It includes the design and implementation of approval processes that are intuitive, secure, and adaptable to various business needs.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approval Workflow | A series of steps or tasks that define the approval process for a specific request or document. |
| First-Class Approval | An approval process that is integrated and native to a system or application, offering the same level of support and functionality as other core features. |
| Automated Approval | The use of software or systems to automatically manage and process approval requests, reducing the need for manual intervention. |
| Approval Template | A pre-defined format or structure used to standardize approval requests, ensuring consistency across different types of approvals. |
| Electronic Signature | A digital equivalent of a handwritten signature, used to authenticate the approval or consent of an individual in an electronic format. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of evolving from email options to first-class approvals include:
- **Integration**: Seamlessly incorporating approval processes into existing systems and workflows.
- **Automation**: Leveraging technology to streamline and expedite approval requests and notifications.
- **Transparency**: Providing clear, real-time visibility into the approval status and process.
- **Security**: Ensuring that approval processes are secure, compliant with regulations, and protected against unauthorized access.
- **Flexibility**: Designing approval workflows that can adapt to different business needs and scenarios.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for first-class approvals typically involves a centralized approval management system that integrates with other business applications. This model includes features such as customizable approval workflows, automated notifications, electronic signatures, and comprehensive auditing and reporting capabilities. It also emphasizes user-friendly interfaces for requesters and approvers, ensuring that the approval process is efficient and straightforward.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in the evolution to first-class approvals include:
- **Parallel Approvals**: Multiple approvals are processed simultaneously to expedite the overall approval time.
- **Sequential Approvals**: Approvals are processed one after another, often used for more complex or sensitive requests.
- **Conditional Approvals**: Approval workflows are dynamically adjusted based on specific conditions or criteria.
- **Delegated Approvals**: The authority to approve is delegated to another user or role, often due to absence or conflict of interest.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns to avoid in the evolution to first-class approvals include:
- **Manual Approval Tracking**: Relying on manual methods (e.g., spreadsheets, email) to track and manage approvals.
- **Lack of Transparency**: Failing to provide clear visibility into the approval process and status.
- **Inflexible Workflows**: Implementing approval workflows that are rigid and cannot adapt to changing business needs.
- **Insufficient Security**: Neglecting to implement adequate security measures to protect approval processes and data.
