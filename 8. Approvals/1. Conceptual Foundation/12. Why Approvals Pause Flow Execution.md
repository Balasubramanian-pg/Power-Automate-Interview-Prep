## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 12. Why Approvals Pause Flow Execution exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Approvals pause flow execution is a crucial aspect of business process management, as it ensures that critical decisions are thoroughly reviewed and validated before proceeding with a workflow. This mechanism exists to address the problem of uncontrolled or unauthorized progression of business processes, which can lead to errors, inefficiencies, or even financial losses. By pausing the flow execution, approvals provide a safety net that enables organizations to verify the accuracy and legitimacy of transactions, requests, or changes, thereby mitigating potential risks.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of approvals pausing flow execution involves a workflow that is temporarily halted at a specific point, awaiting approval or validation from an authorized individual or group. This pause allows for the examination of relevant data, assessment of potential consequences, and verification of compliance with organizational policies or regulatory requirements. Once the approval is granted, the workflow resumes, and the process continues. This high-level model encompasses the key elements of approvals, including the request, evaluation, decision, and notification.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approval | A formal authorization or validation of a request, transaction, or change, typically granted by an authorized individual or group. |
| Workflow | A series of activities or tasks that are organized and executed in a specific order to achieve a particular goal or objective. |
| Pause | A temporary halt or suspension of a workflow, pending approval, validation, or resolution of an issue. |
| Requester | The individual or entity that initiates a request, transaction, or change that requires approval. |
| Approver | The authorized individual or group responsible for evaluating and granting approval for a request, transaction, or change. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of approvals pausing flow execution include:
* **Separation of duties**: The principle of dividing tasks and responsibilities among multiple individuals or groups to prevent a single point of failure or unauthorized actions.
* **Authorization**: The process of granting or denying access to resources, data, or workflows based on an individual's or group's role, permissions, or privileges.
* **Validation**: The process of verifying the accuracy, completeness, or legitimacy of data, requests, or transactions to ensure compliance with organizational policies or regulatory requirements.
* **Notification**: The process of informing relevant stakeholders or individuals of the approval status, progress, or outcome of a workflow or request.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for approvals pausing flow execution typically involves the following steps:
1. **Request submission**: The requester initiates a request, transaction, or change that requires approval.
2. **Workflow pause**: The workflow is temporarily halted, pending approval or validation.
3. **Approval evaluation**: The approver evaluates the request, assessing the potential consequences, verifying compliance, and ensuring accuracy.
4. **Approval decision**: The approver grants or denies approval, and the decision is recorded.
5. **Notification**: The requester and other relevant stakeholders are informed of the approval status or outcome.
6. **Workflow resumption**: The workflow resumes, and the process continues, incorporating any approved changes or updates.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for approvals pausing flow execution include:
* **Serial approval**: A linear sequence of approvals, where each approver must grant approval before the next approver is notified.
* **Parallel approval**: Multiple approvers are notified simultaneously, and approval is granted when all required approvers have responded.
* **Escalation**: If an approver is unavailable or unable to respond, the approval request is escalated to a higher-level approver or manager.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for approvals pausing flow execution include:
* **Unnecessary approvals**: Requiring approvals for trivial or routine requests, leading to inefficiencies and delays.
* **Insufficient validation**: Failing to verify the accuracy or legitimacy of requests, transactions, or changes, potentially leading to errors or unauthorized actions.
* **Inadequate notification**: Failing to inform relevant stakeholders of approval status, progress, or outcomes, leading to confusion or misunderstandings.
