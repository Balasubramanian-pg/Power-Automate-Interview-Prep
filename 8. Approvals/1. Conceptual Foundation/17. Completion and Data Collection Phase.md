# 17. Completion and Data Collection Phase

Canonical documentation for 17. Completion and Data Collection Phase. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
The 17. Completion and Data Collection Phase exists to ensure that all project activities are properly finalized, and relevant data is collected to evaluate project success, identify areas for improvement, and inform future projects. This phase addresses the class of problems related to project closure, data collection, and evaluation, providing a structured approach to completing projects efficiently and effectively.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
The Completion and Data Collection Phase is the final stage of the project lifecycle, where the project team formalizes the completion of project activities, documents lessons learned, and gathers data to assess project outcomes. This phase involves a series of coordinated activities, including project closure, data collection, evaluation, and reporting, to ensure that the project is properly completed and that valuable insights are captured.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Project Closure | The formal process of completing all project activities, documenting lessons learned, and obtaining final acceptance from stakeholders. |
| Data Collection | The systematic gathering of data and information to evaluate project outcomes, identify areas for improvement, and inform future projects. |
| Evaluation | The assessment of project outcomes against planned objectives, to determine the degree of success and identify opportunities for improvement. |
| Lessons Learned | The knowledge and insights gained from the project, which can be applied to future projects to improve performance and outcomes. |
| Project Report | A comprehensive document that summarizes the project's objectives, activities, outcomes, and lessons learned. |

## 4. Core Concepts
The Completion and Data Collection Phase is based on several fundamental ideas, including:
* Project closure: The formal completion of project activities and the obtaining of final acceptance from stakeholders.
* Data-driven decision making: The use of data and information to evaluate project outcomes and inform future projects.
* Continuous improvement: The ongoing effort to identify areas for improvement and implement changes to improve project performance and outcomes.
* Stakeholder engagement: The active involvement of stakeholders in the project closure and evaluation process, to ensure that their needs and expectations are met.

## 5. Standard Model
The standard model for the Completion and Data Collection Phase involves the following steps:
1. Project closure: Formalize the completion of project activities and obtain final acceptance from stakeholders.
2. Data collection: Gather data and information to evaluate project outcomes and identify areas for improvement.
3. Evaluation: Assess project outcomes against planned objectives and identify opportunities for improvement.
4. Reporting: Document the project's objectives, activities, outcomes, and lessons learned in a comprehensive project report.
5. Review and revision: Review the project report and revise as necessary, to ensure that it accurately reflects the project's outcomes and lessons learned.

## 6. Common Patterns
Common patterns in the Completion and Data Collection Phase include:
* The use of project management tools and templates to facilitate project closure and data collection.
* The involvement of stakeholders in the project closure and evaluation process, to ensure that their needs and expectations are met.
* The use of data and information to evaluate project outcomes and inform future projects.
* The documentation of lessons learned and the identification of areas for improvement, to support continuous improvement.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Common but discouraged practices in the Completion and Data Collection Phase include:
* Failing to formally close the project, leading to confusion and uncertainty among stakeholders.
* Neglecting to collect and evaluate data, resulting in a lack of insight into project outcomes and areas for improvement.
* Failing to engage stakeholders in the project closure and evaluation process, leading to a lack of buy-in and support for the project's outcomes.
* Failing to document lessons learned and identify areas for improvement, resulting in a lack of opportunity for continuous improvement.
