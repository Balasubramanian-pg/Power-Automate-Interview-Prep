Canonical documentation for 8. Understanding Dataverse as the Backend for Approvals. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 8. Understanding Dataverse as the Backend for Approvals exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of using Dataverse as the backend for approvals is to provide a scalable, secure, and flexible framework for managing approval processes. This approach addresses the class of problems related to manual, disjointed, and inefficient approval workflows, which can lead to delays, errors, and lack of visibility. By leveraging Dataverse, organizations can streamline their approval processes, improve collaboration, and enhance overall productivity.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Dataverse serves as a unified data platform that integrates with various applications and services, enabling the creation of customized approval workflows. This platform provides a centralized repository for storing and managing data, metadata, and relationships, making it an ideal backend for approval processes. The conceptual overview involves understanding how Dataverse can be used to design, implement, and manage approval workflows, including data modeling, business rules, and integration with external systems.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Dataverse | A cloud-based, low-code data platform for building and managing data-centric applications |
| Approval Workflow | A series of steps and decisions that require approval or rejection, often involving multiple stakeholders and systems |
| Data Model | A conceptual representation of the data structures and relationships used to store and manage data in Dataverse |
| Business Rule | A set of logical conditions and actions that define the behavior of an approval workflow |
| Integration | The process of connecting Dataverse with external applications, services, or systems to enable seamless data exchange and workflow automation |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of using Dataverse as the backend for approvals include:
* Data modeling: designing and implementing a data model that captures the relevant information and relationships for the approval workflow
* Business rules: defining and implementing logical conditions and actions that govern the behavior of the approval workflow
* Workflow automation: using Dataverse to automate the approval workflow, including assigning tasks, sending notifications, and updating data
* Integration: connecting Dataverse with external systems and applications to enable seamless data exchange and workflow automation
* Security and governance: ensuring that the approval workflow is secure, compliant, and aligned with organizational policies and regulations

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for using Dataverse as the backend for approvals involves the following components:
* Data storage: using Dataverse to store and manage data related to the approval workflow
* Workflow engine: leveraging the Dataverse workflow engine to automate the approval workflow
* Business rules engine: using the Dataverse business rules engine to define and implement logical conditions and actions
* Integration layer: connecting Dataverse with external systems and applications using APIs, web services, or other integration mechanisms
* User interface: providing a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to interact with the approval workflow, including submitting requests, reviewing tasks, and approving or rejecting requests

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for using Dataverse as the backend for approvals include:
* Using Dataverse to automate manual approval workflows, such as employee onboarding or procurement requests
* Implementing a centralized approval workflow that integrates with multiple external systems and applications
* Using business rules to enforce organizational policies and regulations, such as compliance checks or budget approvals
* Leveraging Dataverse to provide real-time visibility and tracking of approval workflows, including dashboards and reporting

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for using Dataverse as the backend for approvals include:
* Using Dataverse as a mere data repository, without leveraging its workflow automation and business rules capabilities
* Implementing approval workflows that are overly complex, rigid, or inflexible
* Failing to integrate Dataverse with external systems and applications, resulting in data silos and workflow fragmentation
* Neglecting security and governance considerations, such as access controls, auditing, and compliance
