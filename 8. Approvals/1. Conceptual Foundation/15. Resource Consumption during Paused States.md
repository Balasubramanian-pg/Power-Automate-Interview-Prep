> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 15. Resource Consumption during Paused States exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of understanding resource consumption during paused states is to optimize system performance, reduce unnecessary resource utilization, and improve overall efficiency. The problem space revolves around the challenges of managing resources when systems or applications are in a paused or idle state, which can lead to wasted resources, increased costs, and decreased system reliability.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Resource consumption during paused states refers to the utilization of system resources, such as CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth, when a system or application is not actively processing tasks or is in a dormant state. This concept is crucial in understanding how to minimize resource waste, reduce energy consumption, and optimize system performance.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Paused State | A state in which a system or application is not actively processing tasks, but is still consuming resources. |
| Resource Consumption | The utilization of system resources, such as CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth. |
| Idle Resource | A system resource that is not being utilized or is underutilized. |
| Power Management | The process of managing power consumption to reduce energy waste and optimize system performance. |
| System Suspension | A state in which a system or application is temporarily halted, but can be quickly resumed. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of resource consumption during paused states include understanding the types of resources being consumed, identifying the causes of resource waste, and developing strategies to minimize unnecessary resource utilization. This includes understanding the differences between various paused states, such as sleep, hibernate, and suspend, and how each state affects resource consumption.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for managing resource consumption during paused states involves a combination of power management techniques, such as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling, and resource allocation strategies, such as dynamic resource allocation and deallocation. This model also includes monitoring and analyzing resource utilization patterns to identify areas for optimization.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for managing resource consumption during paused states include:
* Implementing power management policies to reduce energy consumption during idle periods.
* Using dynamic resource allocation to optimize resource utilization.
* Implementing suspend and resume mechanisms to quickly transition between active and paused states.
* Monitoring and analyzing resource utilization patterns to identify areas for optimization.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for managing resource consumption during paused states include:
* Failing to implement power management policies, leading to unnecessary energy consumption.
* Over-allocating resources, leading to waste and decreased system performance.
* Failing to monitor and analyze resource utilization patterns, leading to missed opportunities for optimization.
* Implementing suspend and resume mechanisms that are slow or inefficient.
