> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 123. Power Platform Governance for Approval Data exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Power Platform Governance for Approval Data is designed to provide a structured approach to managing approval processes within the Power Platform. This includes defining policies, procedures, and standards for approval data management, ensuring data quality, security, and compliance with regulatory requirements. The primary problem this governance model addresses is the lack of standardized approval processes, which can lead to inefficiencies, errors, and non-compliance.
