Canonical documentation for 104. Nested Condition Architecture for Stage Approval. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 104. Nested Condition Architecture for Stage Approval exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Nested Condition Architecture for Stage Approval is designed to address the complex conditional logic required for multi-stage approval processes. It provides a structured approach to managing nested conditions, enabling organizations to define, implement, and maintain sophisticated approval workflows. The primary problem this architecture solves is the need for a scalable, flexible, and maintainable way to model and execute conditional logic in stage approval processes.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Nested Condition Architecture for Stage Approval is based on a hierarchical model, where conditions are nested within each other to form a tree-like structure. Each condition represents a specific criterion or rule that must be evaluated, and the nesting of conditions allows for the creation of complex logical expressions. This architecture enables the definition of approval stages, each with its own set of conditions, and the conditional transition between stages.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Condition | A specific criterion or rule that must be evaluated |
| Stage | A distinct phase in the approval process |
| Nested Condition | A condition that contains one or more other conditions |
| Conditional Logic | The rules and criteria used to evaluate conditions and determine the next stage |
| Approval Workflow | The overall process of evaluating conditions and transitioning between stages |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Nested Condition Architecture for Stage Approval include:
* Conditions: The basic building blocks of the architecture, representing specific criteria or rules.
* Nesting: The ability to embed conditions within each other, creating complex logical expressions.
* Stages: Distinct phases in the approval process, each with its own set of conditions.
* Conditional Logic: The rules and criteria used to evaluate conditions and determine the next stage.
* Approval Workflow: The overall process of evaluating conditions and transitioning between stages.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the Nested Condition Architecture for Stage Approval consists of the following components:
* A hierarchical structure of conditions, with each condition representing a specific criterion or rule.
* A set of stages, each with its own set of conditions.
* A conditional logic engine that evaluates conditions and determines the next stage.
* An approval workflow that defines the overall process of evaluating conditions and transitioning between stages.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in the Nested Condition Architecture for Stage Approval include:
* Using nested conditions to create complex logical expressions.
* Defining stages with specific conditions and conditional logic.
* Implementing approval workflows that transition between stages based on condition evaluation.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in the Nested Condition Architecture for Stage Approval include:
* Using overly complex nested conditions that are difficult to maintain.
* Defining stages with ambiguous or conflicting conditions.
* Implementing approval workflows that are inflexible or difficult to modify.
