# 105. Handling Rejections at Stage 1 vs Stage 2

Canonical documentation for 105. Handling Rejections at Stage 1 vs Stage 2. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 105. Handling Rejections at Stage 1 vs Stage 2 exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of handling rejections at Stage 1 vs Stage 2 is to provide a framework for managing and mitigating the impact of rejections in a multi-stage process. The class of problems it addresses includes reducing the likelihood of rejections, minimizing the impact of rejections, and improving the overall efficiency of the process. This is particularly important in applications where rejections can have significant consequences, such as in financial transactions, medical procedures, or critical system operations.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of handling rejections at Stage 1 vs Stage 2 involves understanding the differences between these two stages and how rejections are handled at each stage. Stage 1 typically refers to the initial screening or evaluation phase, where initial checks are performed to determine whether a request or application meets the basic criteria. Stage 2, on the other hand, involves a more detailed evaluation or processing phase, where a more thorough assessment is conducted. Rejections at Stage 1 are often due to non-compliance with basic requirements, while rejections at Stage 2 may be due to more complex issues or failures to meet specific criteria.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Stage 1 Rejection | A rejection that occurs during the initial screening or evaluation phase, typically due to non-compliance with basic requirements. |
| Stage 2 Rejection | A rejection that occurs during the detailed evaluation or processing phase, often due to more complex issues or failures to meet specific criteria. |
| Rejection Rate | The percentage of requests or applications that are rejected at a particular stage. |
| Rejection Reason | The specific reason or cause for a rejection, which can be used to improve the process or provide feedback. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of handling rejections at Stage 1 vs Stage 2 include understanding the rejection rates and reasons at each stage, identifying the root causes of rejections, and implementing strategies to mitigate or prevent rejections. This may involve streamlining the process, improving communication, or providing additional support or resources to applicants or requesters.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for handling rejections at Stage 1 vs Stage 2 involves a multi-step approach, including: (1) initial screening and evaluation at Stage 1, (2) detailed evaluation and processing at Stage 2, (3) rejection notification and feedback, and (4) continuous process improvement. This model emphasizes the importance of clear communication, timely feedback, and ongoing evaluation and refinement of the process.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in handling rejections at Stage 1 vs Stage 2 include: (1) using automated systems for initial screening and evaluation, (2) providing clear and concise rejection notifications and feedback, (3) offering appeals or review processes for rejected applicants or requesters, and (4) conducting regular process reviews and improvements to reduce rejection rates and improve overall efficiency.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in handling rejections at Stage 1 vs Stage 2 include: (1) using overly complex or ambiguous evaluation criteria, (2) failing to provide timely or clear rejection notifications and feedback, (3) not offering appeals or review processes for rejected applicants or requesters, and (4) neglecting to conduct regular process reviews and improvements.
