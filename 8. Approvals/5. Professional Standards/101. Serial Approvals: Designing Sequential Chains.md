Canonical documentation for 101. Serial Approvals: Designing Sequential Chains. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 101. Serial Approvals: Designing Sequential Chains exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 101. Serial Approvals: Designing Sequential Chains is to provide a structured approach to managing sequential approval processes, which are commonly found in business, administrative, and technical domains. The class of problems it addresses includes inefficient approval workflows, lack of transparency, and inadequate control mechanisms. Serial approvals are essential in scenarios where multiple stakeholders need to review and approve a request, document, or decision in a specific order.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of serial approvals involves a linear sequence of approval stages, where each stage represents a decision point. The process starts with an initial request or proposal, which is then routed through a series of approval stages. At each stage, the request is reviewed, and a decision is made to either approve, reject, or request modifications. The process continues until the request has been fully approved or rejected.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approval Stage | A single decision point in the serial approval process where a reviewer evaluates the request and makes a decision. |
| Approval Chain | The linear sequence of approval stages that a request must pass through to be fully approved. |
| Requester | The individual or entity that initiates the serial approval process by submitting a request. |
| Reviewer | The individual or entity responsible for evaluating the request at a specific approval stage. |
| Approval Threshold | The minimum number of approvals required for a request to be considered fully approved. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of serial approvals include:
* **Sequentiality**: Approval stages are executed in a specific order, with each stage building on the previous one.
* **Linearity**: The approval process follows a linear sequence, with no parallel or concurrent approval stages.
* **Decision Points**: Each approval stage represents a decision point, where the reviewer evaluates the request and makes a decision.
* **Transparency**: The serial approval process provides a clear audit trail, allowing stakeholders to track the progress of the request.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for serial approvals involves the following components:
* **Request Submission**: The requester submits a request, which is then routed to the first approval stage.
* **Approval Stages**: The request is evaluated at each approval stage, with the reviewer making a decision to approve, reject, or request modifications.
* **Approval Threshold**: The request is considered fully approved when it has met the approval threshold, which is the minimum number of approvals required.
* **Notification**: Stakeholders are notified of the approval decision, and the request is either implemented or rejected.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in serial approvals include:
* **Hierarchical Approvals**: Approval stages are organized in a hierarchical structure, with higher-level reviewers evaluating requests that have been approved by lower-level reviewers.
* **Parallel Review**: Multiple reviewers evaluate the request simultaneously, but their approvals are still sequential, with each reviewer building on the previous one.
* **Conditional Approvals**: Approval stages are conditional, with the request being routed to different approval stages based on specific criteria.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in serial approvals include:
* **Approval Bottlenecks**: A single approval stage becomes a bottleneck, causing delays in the approval process.
* **Lack of Transparency**: The approval process is not transparent, making it difficult for stakeholders to track the progress of the request.
* **Insufficient Feedback**: Reviewers do not provide sufficient feedback to the requester, making it difficult to improve the request.
