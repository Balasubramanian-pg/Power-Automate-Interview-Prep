Canonical documentation for 101. Serial Approvals: Designing Sequential Chains. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 101. Serial Approvals: Designing Sequential Chains exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 101. Serial Approvals: Designing Sequential Chains is to provide a structured approach to managing sequential approval processes, which are commonly found in business operations, regulatory compliance, and quality control. The class of problems it addresses includes inefficient approval workflows, lack of transparency, and inadequate control over sequential decision-making processes. By implementing serial approvals, organizations can streamline their workflows, reduce errors, and improve overall productivity.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of 101. Serial Approvals: Designing Sequential Chains involves a series of sequential steps, each representing a distinct approval stage. Each stage is associated with a specific set of criteria, stakeholders, and decision-making authorities. The sequential chain is designed to ensure that each stage is completed before proceeding to the next one, thereby maintaining a controlled and predictable workflow.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approval Stage | A distinct step in the sequential approval process, characterized by specific criteria and decision-making authorities. |
| Sequential Chain | A series of approval stages, where each stage is dependent on the completion of the previous one. |
| Stakeholder | An individual or group with a vested interest in the approval process, often responsible for providing input or making decisions at specific stages. |
| Decision-Making Authority | The person or entity responsible for making decisions at a particular approval stage. |
| Workflow | The overall process of managing sequential approvals, including the flow of information, tasks, and decisions. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 101. Serial Approvals: Designing Sequential Chains include:
* **Sequentiality**: The idea that each approval stage is dependent on the completion of the previous one, ensuring a controlled and predictable workflow.
* **Stakeholder Management**: The process of identifying, engaging, and managing stakeholders throughout the approval process.
* **Decision-Making Authority**: The concept of assigning decision-making authority to specific individuals or groups at each approval stage.
* **Transparency and Auditing**: The importance of maintaining a clear and transparent record of the approval process, including all decisions, actions, and stakeholders involved.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 101. Serial Approvals: Designing Sequential Chains involves the following components:
* **Initiation**: The initial stage of the approval process, where the request is submitted and reviewed.
* **Sequential Stages**: A series of approval stages, each with its own set of criteria, stakeholders, and decision-making authorities.
* **Decision Points**: Specific points in the workflow where decisions are made, and the process proceeds to the next stage.
* **Completion**: The final stage of the approval process, where the request is either approved, rejected, or sent back for revision.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in 101. Serial Approvals: Designing Sequential Chains include:
* **Linear Approval**: A straightforward, sequential approval process with a fixed set of stages and decision points.
* **Parallel Approval**: A process where multiple approval stages occur simultaneously, with decisions made independently.
* **Conditional Approval**: A process where the approval workflow is dynamic, with stages and decision points determined by specific conditions or criteria.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in 101. Serial Approvals: Designing Sequential Chains include:
* **Unnecessary Complexity**: Overly complicated approval workflows, leading to confusion, delays, and inefficiencies.
* **Lack of Transparency**: Inadequate documentation or visibility into the approval process, making it difficult to track decisions and actions.
* **Insufficient Stakeholder Management**: Failure to engage or manage stakeholders effectively, leading to misunderstandings, conflicts, or missed deadlines.
