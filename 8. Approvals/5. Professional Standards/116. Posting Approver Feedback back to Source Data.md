# 116. Posting Approver Feedback back to Source Data

Canonical documentation for 116. Posting Approver Feedback back to Source Data. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 116. Posting Approver Feedback back to Source Data exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of posting approver feedback back to source data is to ensure that the original data source is updated with the feedback and approval status, enabling data consistency and integrity across systems. This process addresses the problem of data silos and inconsistencies that can arise when feedback and approval information is not properly synchronized with the source data.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of posting approver feedback back to source data involves a feedback loop where approver feedback is collected, processed, and then updated back to the source data system. This loop ensures that the source data remains up-to-date and accurate, reflecting the latest approval status and feedback.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approver Feedback | Comments or evaluations provided by approvers regarding the data or content. |
| Source Data | The original data or content that is being reviewed and approved. |
| Approval Status | The current state of the approval process, such as pending, approved, or rejected. |
| Data Synchronization | The process of ensuring that data is consistent and up-to-date across multiple systems. |
| Feedback Loop | The cyclical process of collecting, processing, and updating feedback and approval information. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of posting approver feedback back to source data include data consistency, approval workflow, and feedback collection. Data consistency ensures that the source data remains accurate and up-to-date, while the approval workflow defines the process by which approvers review and provide feedback on the data. Feedback collection involves gathering and processing approver feedback to update the source data.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for posting approver feedback back to source data involves the following steps:
1. Data submission: The source data is submitted for review and approval.
2. Approval workflow: Approvers review the data and provide feedback.
3. Feedback collection: The approver feedback is collected and processed.
4. Data update: The source data is updated with the approver feedback and approval status.
5. Data synchronization: The updated source data is synchronized across systems to ensure data consistency.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for posting approver feedback back to source data include:
* Using automated workflows to streamline the approval process and reduce manual errors.
* Implementing data validation rules to ensure data consistency and accuracy.
* Providing real-time feedback and updates to ensure that all stakeholders are informed and up-to-date.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for posting approver feedback back to source data include:
* Manual data entry, which can lead to errors and inconsistencies.
* Lack of data validation, which can result in inaccurate or incomplete data.
* Inadequate feedback mechanisms, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications.
