# 120. Designing for Resiliency: Dealing with User Leave

Canonical documentation for 120. Designing for Resiliency: Dealing with User Leave. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 120. Designing for Resiliency: Dealing with User Leave exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of designing for resiliency in the context of user leave is to ensure that systems, applications, and services can withstand and recover from the loss of key personnel, minimizing disruptions to operations and maintaining continuity. The problem space includes scenarios where user leave, whether planned or unplanned, impacts the availability, reliability, and performance of critical systems.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Designing for resiliency when dealing with user leave involves a holistic approach that encompasses people, processes, and technology. It requires understanding the roles and responsibilities of users, identifying critical tasks and dependencies, and implementing strategies to mitigate the risks associated with user absence. This includes cross-training, documentation, automation, and ensuring that knowledge and expertise are not concentrated in a single individual.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Resiliency | The ability of a system, application, or service to withstand and recover from disruptions, including those caused by user leave. |
| User Leave | The temporary or permanent absence of a user from their role, which can impact system operations. |
| Critical Tasks | Essential activities that must be performed to maintain system continuity and operations. |
| Knowledge Silo | A situation where critical knowledge or expertise is concentrated in a single individual, posing a risk to system resiliency. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of designing for resiliency in the context of user leave include:
- **Redundancy**: Ensuring that critical tasks can be performed by more than one individual.
- **Cross-training**: Providing training to multiple users to perform critical tasks.
- **Documentation**: Maintaining up-to-date documentation of processes, systems, and critical tasks.
- **Automation**: Automating tasks where possible to reduce dependence on individual users.
- **Succession Planning**: Identifying and developing future replacements for key roles.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for designing for resiliency when dealing with user leave involves a proactive and multi-faceted approach:
1. **Risk Assessment**: Identify critical tasks and the impact of user leave on system operations.
2. **Strategy Development**: Develop strategies to mitigate identified risks, including cross-training, documentation, and automation.
3. **Implementation**: Implement developed strategies, ensuring that knowledge and expertise are distributed among multiple users.
4. **Monitoring and Review**: Continuously monitor the effectiveness of implemented strategies and review them for necessary updates or adjustments.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in designing for resiliency include:
- **Job Shadowing**: Pairing users with more experienced counterparts to learn critical tasks.
- **Mentorship Programs**: Establishing formal mentorship programs to transfer knowledge and expertise.
- **Regular Team Meetings**: Holding regular meetings to discuss ongoing projects, share knowledge, and address concerns.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in this context include:
- **Single Point of Failure**: Allowing critical knowledge or tasks to be concentrated in a single user.
- **Lack of Documentation**: Failing to maintain up-to-date documentation of critical tasks and processes.
- **Inadequate Training**: Not providing adequate training to users, leading to a lack of redundancy in critical tasks.
