# 112. Using Do Until for Iterative Approvals

Canonical documentation for 112. Using Do Until for Iterative Approaches. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 112. Using Do Until for Iterative Approvals exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of using Do Until for iterative approvals is to provide a mechanism for repeatedly executing a set of actions until a specific condition is met, typically in the context of obtaining approvals or validating inputs. This approach addresses the class of problems where a process requires multiple iterations of review, revision, and re-submission, such as document approvals, workflow management, or quality control checks.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Do Until loop is a control structure that enables iterative execution of a block of code or a set of actions until a specified condition is satisfied. In the context of iterative approvals, this loop allows for repeated submission, review, and revision of a document, request, or item until it meets the required criteria or receives the necessary approvals.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Do Until Loop | A control structure that executes a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met. |
| Iterative Approvals | A process where a document, request, or item is repeatedly submitted, reviewed, and revised until it meets the required criteria or receives the necessary approvals. |
| Condition | A statement or expression that evaluates to true or false, used to determine when to exit the Do Until loop. |
| Approval Threshold | The minimum number of approvals or the specific criteria required for a document, request, or item to be considered approved. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of using Do Until for iterative approvals include:
* The Do Until loop as a control structure for iterative execution
* The definition of a condition that determines when to exit the loop
* The establishment of an approval threshold that must be met for the process to be considered complete
* The ability to submit, review, and revise documents, requests, or items repeatedly until the approval threshold is met

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for using Do Until for iterative approvals involves the following steps:
1. Initialize the Do Until loop with a condition that evaluates to true.
2. Execute the block of code or set of actions within the loop.
3. Evaluate the condition at the end of each iteration.
4. If the condition is met, exit the loop.
5. If the condition is not met, repeat the loop until the condition is satisfied or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for using Do Until for iterative approvals include:
* Using a counter to track the number of iterations
* Implementing a timeout or maximum number of iterations to prevent infinite loops
* Providing feedback to users on the status of the approval process
* Allowing for manual intervention or override of the approval process

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for using Do Until for iterative approvals include:
* Using a Do Until loop without a clear condition for exiting the loop
* Failing to provide feedback to users on the status of the approval process
* Not implementing a timeout or maximum number of iterations to prevent infinite loops
* Using a Do Until loop for processes that require a fixed number of iterations, where a For loop would be more suitable
