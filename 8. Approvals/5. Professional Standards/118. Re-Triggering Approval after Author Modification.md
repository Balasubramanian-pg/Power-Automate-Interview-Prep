## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 118. Re-Triggering Approval after Author Modification exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of re-triggering approval after author modification is to ensure that changes made by an author to a previously approved document, process, or system are re-evaluated and validated to maintain the integrity and accuracy of the approved content. This addresses the problem of outdated or incorrect information being used, which can lead to errors, inconsistencies, and potential risks.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of re-triggering approval after author modification involves a workflow that includes the initial approval of a document, process, or system, followed by modifications made by an author. Upon modification, the approval status is reset, and the revised content is re-submitted for approval, ensuring that all changes are evaluated and validated.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Author | The individual or entity responsible for making modifications to the approved content. |
| Approval | The process of validating and accepting the content, ensuring it meets the required standards and criteria. |
| Re-Triggering | The act of re-initiating the approval process after modifications have been made to the approved content. |
| Modification | Changes made to the approved content, which can include updates, revisions, or edits. |
| Workflow | The sequence of processes and tasks involved in the approval and re-approval of content. |

## 4. Core Concepts
