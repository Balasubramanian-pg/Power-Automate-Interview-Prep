# 102. Multi-Stage Manager or Director Logic

Canonical documentation for 102. Multi-Stage Manager or Director Logic. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 102. Multi-Stage Manager or Director Logic exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Multi-Stage Manager or Director Logic exists to provide a structured approach to managing complex, multi-stage processes and workflows. It addresses the class of problems related to coordinating and orchestrating multiple tasks, activities, or stages in a specific order, ensuring that each stage is completed successfully before proceeding to the next one. This logic is essential in various domains, such as software development, business process management, and project management, where the outcome of each stage significantly impacts the overall success of the project or process.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Multi-Stage Manager or Director Logic can be conceptualized as a state machine that manages the progression of a process or workflow through multiple stages. Each stage represents a specific task, activity, or set of activities that must be completed before moving on to the next stage. The logic ensures that the process flows smoothly from one stage to the next, handling any errors, exceptions, or feedback that may occur during each stage. This high-level model provides a foundation for understanding the complexities of multi-stage management and the role of the director logic in orchestrating the entire process.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Stage | A specific task, activity, or set of activities that must be completed as part of a larger process or workflow. |
| Director Logic | The underlying logic that manages the progression of a process or workflow through multiple stages. |
| State Machine | A mathematical model that can be in one of a finite number of states, transitioning between states based on specific rules or inputs. |
| Workflow | A series of tasks, activities, or stages that are coordinated and managed to achieve a specific goal or outcome. |
| Process | A set of activities, tasks, or stages that are designed to achieve a specific objective or produce a particular output. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Multi-Stage Manager or Director Logic include:
* **Stage Management**: The ability to define, manage, and coordinate multiple stages within a process or workflow.
* **State Transition**: The process of moving from one stage to the next, based on specific rules, conditions, or inputs.
* **Error Handling**: The ability to detect, handle, and recover from errors or exceptions that occur during each stage.
* **Feedback Mechanisms**: The ability to provide feedback and insights to stakeholders, allowing them to make informed decisions and take corrective actions.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the Multi-Stage Manager or Director Logic involves the following components:
* **Stage Definition**: A clear definition of each stage, including the tasks, activities, and deliverables required.
* **State Machine**: A state machine that manages the progression of the process or workflow through each stage.
* **Transition Rules**: A set of rules that govern the transition from one stage to the next.
* **Error Handling Mechanisms**: A set of mechanisms for detecting, handling, and recovering from errors or exceptions.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in the Multi-Stage Manager or Director Logic include:
* **Linear Stage Progression**: A linear progression from one stage to the next, with each stage building on the previous one.
* **Iterative Stage Refinement**: An iterative approach to stage refinement, where each stage is refined and improved based on feedback and insights.
* **Parallel Stage Execution**: The ability to execute multiple stages in parallel, improving overall efficiency and productivity.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in the Multi-Stage Manager or Director Logic include:
* **Overly Complex Stage Definitions**: Stage definitions that are overly complex, ambiguous, or poorly defined.
* **Inadequate Error Handling**: Inadequate error handling mechanisms, leading to errors or exceptions being propagated throughout the process or workflow.
* **Insufficient Feedback Mechanisms**: Insufficient feedback mechanisms, making it difficult for stakeholders to make informed decisions or take corrective actions.
