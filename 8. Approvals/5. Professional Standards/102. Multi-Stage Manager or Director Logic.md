> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 102. Multi-Stage Manager or Director Logic exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Multi-Stage Manager or Director Logic exists to provide a structured approach to managing complex, multi-stage processes and workflows. It addresses the class of problems related to coordinating and orchestrating multiple tasks, activities, or stages in a sequential or parallel manner, ensuring that each stage is properly executed, and the overall process is efficiently managed. This logic is essential in various domains, such as software development, business process management, and project management, where multiple stages or phases need to be coordinated to achieve a specific goal.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Multi-Stage Manager or Director Logic can be conceptualized as a hierarchical or sequential structure, comprising multiple stages or phases, each with its own set of tasks, activities, or processes. This structure is managed by a central director or manager, responsible for orchestrating the flow of work, resources, and information across the different stages. The logic involves defining the stages, specifying the dependencies and relationships between them, and establishing the rules and conditions for transitioning from one stage to the next.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Stage | A distinct phase or step in a multi-stage process or workflow |
| Director | The central manager or orchestrator responsible for coordinating the multi-stage process |
| Manager | A component or entity responsible for managing a specific stage or subset of stages |
| Transition | The act of moving from one stage to another, based on predefined rules and conditions |
| Dependency | A relationship between stages, where the completion of one stage is required before another stage can begin |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Multi-Stage Manager or Director Logic include:
* **Stage definition**: Clearly defining the scope, objectives, and deliverables of each stage
* **Dependency management**: Identifying and managing the relationships and dependencies between stages
* **Transition rules**: Establishing the conditions and criteria for transitioning from one stage to another
* **Resource allocation**: Assigning and managing resources, such as personnel, materials, and equipment, across the different stages
* **Monitoring and control**: Tracking progress, identifying deviations, and taking corrective actions to ensure the successful execution of the multi-stage process

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the Multi-Stage Manager or Director Logic involves a hierarchical structure, with the director or manager at the top, overseeing the entire process. Each stage is represented by a manager or component, responsible for executing the specific tasks and activities associated with that stage. The model includes the following components:
* **Director**: The central manager or orchestrator
* **Stage managers**: Responsible for managing individual stages
* **Stage components**: The specific tasks, activities, or processes executed within each stage
* **Transition mechanisms**: The rules, conditions, and protocols for transitioning between stages

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in the Multi-Stage Manager or Director Logic include:
* **Sequential execution**: Stages are executed in a linear sequence, with each stage completing before the next one begins
* **Parallel execution**: Multiple stages are executed concurrently, with synchronization mechanisms to ensure coordination and consistency
* **Iterative refinement**: Stages are repeated, with feedback and refinement, to achieve a specific goal or objective
* **Conditional transitions**: Transitions between stages are based on specific conditions, such as the completion of a previous stage or the availability of resources

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in the Multi-Stage Manager or Director Logic include:
* **Overly rigid structures**: Inflexible stage definitions and transition rules, which can hinder adaptability and responsiveness to changing requirements
* **Insufficient dependency management**: Failing to identify and manage dependencies between stages, leading to delays, bottlenecks, or errors
* **Inadequate resource allocation**: Failing to allocate sufficient resources, or allocating them inefficiently, leading to stage delays or failures
* **Lack of monitoring and control**: Failing to track progress, identify deviations, or take corrective actions, leading to process failures or suboptimal outcomes
