> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 125. Final Checklist for Production-Ready Approval Flows exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of the 125. Final Checklist for Production-Ready Approval Flows is to ensure that all necessary steps have been taken to guarantee the reliability, security, and performance of approval flows before they are deployed to a production environment. This checklist addresses the class of problems related to inadequate testing, insufficient validation, and poor change management, which can lead to errors, downtime, and reputational damage.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The 125. Final Checklist for Production-Ready Approval Flows is a systematic approach to verifying that all aspects of an approval flow have been properly evaluated, tested, and validated. This includes reviewing the flow's design, configuration, and implementation, as well as assessing its performance, security, and compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approval Flow | A series of steps or processes that require approval or validation before proceeding to the next stage. |
| Production-Ready | A state in which a system, application, or process is fully functional, tested, and validated, and is ready to be deployed to a live production environment. |
| Checklist | A systematic list of items or tasks that must be completed or verified before a process or system can be considered complete or ready for deployment. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the 125. Final Checklist for Production-Ready Approval Flows include:
* **Comprehensive Testing**: Verifying that all aspects of the approval flow have been thoroughly tested, including functional, performance, security, and usability testing.
* **Validation and Verification**: Ensuring that the approval flow meets all relevant requirements, standards, and regulations, and that it functions as intended.
* **Change Management**: Implementing a structured approach to managing changes to the approval flow, including assessing, testing, and validating all changes before deployment.
* **Security and Compliance**: Ensuring that the approval flow is secure, compliant with relevant regulations and standards, and that all sensitive data is properly protected.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the 125. Final Checklist for Production-Ready Approval Flows includes the following stages:
1. **Pre-Deployment Review**: A thorough review of the approval flow's design, configuration, and implementation.
2. **Testing and Validation**: Comprehensive testing and validation of the approval flow, including functional, performance, security, and usability testing.
3. **Change Management**: Implementation of a structured approach to managing changes to the approval flow.
4. **Security and Compliance Review**: A review of the approval flow's security and compliance with relevant regulations and standards.
5. **Final Verification**: A final verification that all necessary steps have been taken to ensure the approval flow is production-ready.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for the 125. Final Checklist for Production-Ready Approval Flows include:
* **Automated Testing**: Using automated testing tools to verify the approval flow's functionality and performance.
* **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Implementing a CI/CD pipeline to automate the testing, validation, and deployment of the approval flow.
* **Collaborative Review**: Conducting collaborative reviews of the approval flow's design, configuration, and implementation to ensure that all stakeholders are aligned and that all necessary steps have been taken.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for the 125. Final Checklist for Production-Ready Approval Flows include:
* **Insufficient Testing**: Failing to thoroughly test the approval flow, including functional, performance, security, and usability testing.
* **Poor Change Management**: Failing to implement a structured approach to managing changes to the approval flow, leading to errors, downtime, and reputational damage.
* **Inadequate Security and Compliance**: Failing to ensure that the approval flow is secure, compliant with relevant regulations and standards, and that all sensitive data is properly protected.
