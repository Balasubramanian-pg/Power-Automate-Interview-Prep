Canonical documentation for 124. Securing Approval Content and Links. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 124. Securing Approval Content and Links exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 124. Securing Approval Content and Links is to ensure that sensitive information and links used in approval processes are protected from unauthorized access, tampering, and other security threats. This is crucial in maintaining the integrity of business processes, preventing data breaches, and complying with regulatory requirements. The class of problems it addresses includes unauthorized access to sensitive information, data tampering, and phishing attacks.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of 124. Securing Approval Content and Links involves a multi-layered approach to security, including authentication, authorization, encryption, and access control. It encompasses the protection of approval content, such as documents and messages, as well as links to external resources, like websites and web applications. This model recognizes the importance of secure communication protocols, like HTTPS, and the use of secure protocols for data transmission.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approval Content | Sensitive information used in approval processes, such as documents, messages, and data. |
| Secure Link | A link to an external resource that is protected from unauthorized access and tampering. |
| Authentication | The process of verifying the identity of users, systems, or entities. |
| Authorization | The process of granting access to approved users, systems, or entities. |
| Encryption | The process of converting plaintext into unreadable ciphertext to protect data. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 124. Securing Approval Content and Links include:
* **Confidentiality**: Protecting approval content from unauthorized access.
* **Integrity**: Ensuring that approval content and links are not tampered with or altered.
* **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of users and systems accessing approval content and links.
* **Authorization**: Controlling access to approval content and links based on user roles and permissions.
* **Non-Repudiation**: Ensuring that the origin and integrity of approval content and links can be verified.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 124. Securing Approval Content and Links involves a combination of security controls, including:
* **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**: Encrypting data in transit using protocols like HTTPS.
* **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Controlling access to approval content and links based on user roles and permissions.
* **Digital Signatures**: Verifying the authenticity and integrity of approval content and links.
* **Secure Storage**: Protecting approval content and links at rest using encryption and access controls.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for 124. Securing Approval Content and Links include:
* **Secure by Design**: Incorporating security into the design of approval processes and systems.
* **Least Privilege**: Granting users and systems only the necessary access and permissions to perform their tasks.
* **Separation of Duties**: Dividing tasks and responsibilities to prevent a single point of failure or vulnerability.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for 124. Securing Approval Content and Links include:
* **Hardcoding Sensitive Information**: Embedding sensitive information, like passwords or encryption keys, directly into code or scripts.
* **Using Insecure Protocols**: Transmitting sensitive information using unencrypted or insecure protocols, like HTTP or FTP.
* **Ignoring Security Updates**: Failing to apply security patches or updates to systems and software.
