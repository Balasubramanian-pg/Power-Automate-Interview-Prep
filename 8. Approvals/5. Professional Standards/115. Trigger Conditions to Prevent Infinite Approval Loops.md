> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 115. Trigger Conditions to Prevent Infinite Approval Loops exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Trigger Conditions to Prevent Infinite Approval Loops is to establish a set of guidelines and best practices for designing and implementing approval workflows that avoid infinite loops. Infinite approval loops occur when an approval process is triggered repeatedly without terminating, causing unnecessary delays, and potentially leading to system crashes or data inconsistencies. This document addresses the class of problems related to approval workflow design, implementation, and optimization.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Trigger Conditions to Prevent Infinite Approval Loops involves a systematic approach to identifying potential infinite loops in approval workflows. This approach includes analyzing workflow triggers, conditions, and actions to detect and prevent recursive loops. The conceptual model consists of three primary components: 
1. **Trigger**: An event or condition that initiates an approval workflow.
2. **Condition**: A set of rules or criteria that determine the next step in the approval workflow.
3. **Action**: The outcome or result of the approval workflow, which may trigger another workflow or terminate the process.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approval Workflow | A series of processes or tasks that require approval or validation before proceeding to the next step. |
| Infinite Loop | A recursive process that repeats indefinitely without terminating, causing unnecessary delays or system crashes. |
| Trigger Condition | A set of rules or criteria that determine when an approval workflow should be initiated or terminated. |
| Recursive Loop | A process that repeats itself, potentially leading to an infinite loop if not properly terminated. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Trigger Conditions to Prevent Infinite Approval Loops include:
1. **Workflow Analysis**: Identifying potential infinite loops in approval workflows by analyzing triggers, conditions, and actions.
2. **Trigger Optimization**: Optimizing workflow triggers to prevent recursive loops and ensure efficient approval processes.
3. **Condition Validation**: Validating conditions to ensure that they are clear, unambiguous, and prevent infinite loops.
4. **Action Termination**: Ensuring that approval workflows terminate properly to prevent infinite loops.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Trigger Conditions to Prevent Infinite Approval Loops involves a structured approach to approval workflow design and implementation:
1. **Define Workflow Triggers**: Clearly define the events or conditions that initiate approval workflows.
2. **Establish Conditions**: Establish clear, unambiguous conditions for each step in the approval workflow.
3. **Specify Actions**: Specify the outcomes or results of each approval workflow step.
4. **Analyze and Optimize**: Analyze and optimize workflow triggers, conditions, and actions to prevent infinite loops.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Trigger Conditions to Prevent Infinite Approval Loops include:
1. **Linear Approval Workflows**: Sequential approval workflows with clear, unambiguous conditions and actions.
2. **Parallel Approval Workflows**: Concurrent approval workflows with multiple parallel paths.
3. **Conditional Approval Workflows**: Approval workflows with conditional triggers and actions.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Trigger Conditions to Prevent Infinite Approval Loops include:
1. **Unbounded Recursion**: Approval workflows with unbounded recursive loops, leading to infinite loops.
2. **Ambiguous Conditions**: Approval workflows with ambiguous or unclear conditions, leading to confusion and potential infinite loops.
3. **Inadequate Termination**: Approval workflows without proper termination, leading to infinite loops.
