> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 114. Logic for Request Rework vs Rejected exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 114. Logic for Request Rework vs Rejected is to provide a clear distinction between requests that require rework and those that are rejected outright. This logic exists to address the class of problems related to request processing, where the lack of clear criteria for rework versus rejection can lead to confusion, inefficiency, and inconsistent decision-making. The problem space includes scenarios where requests are incorrectly labeled as rework or rejected, resulting in unnecessary delays, wasted resources, or poor customer experience.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of 114. Logic for Request Rework vs Rejected involves understanding the request lifecycle, from submission to resolution. It encompasses the evaluation of requests against predefined criteria, which determines whether a request should be reworked, rejected, or approved. This mental model considers the interplay between request characteristics, evaluation criteria, and the resulting actions, ensuring a systematic approach to request processing.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Request | A formal ask or application for something, typically requiring evaluation or approval. |
| Rework | The process of revising or amending a request to meet the required standards or criteria. |
| Rejection | The act of denying or refusing a request, often due to failure to meet necessary criteria. |
| Evaluation Criteria | Predefined standards or requirements used to assess requests and determine the appropriate course of action. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 114. Logic for Request Rework vs Rejected include:
- **Request Evaluation**: Assessing requests against established criteria to determine their viability or compliance.
- **Decision Thresholds**: Defined levels of criteria fulfillment that dictate whether a request should be reworked, rejected, or approved.
- **Process Transparency**: Ensuring that the logic and criteria used for request evaluation are clear, accessible, and consistently applied.
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Channels for communicating the outcome of request evaluations, including reasons for rework or rejection, to facilitate improvement or correction.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 114. Logic for Request Rework vs Rejected involves a stepwise approach:
1. **Request Submission**: The initial step where a request is formally made.
2. **Evaluation**: Assessing the request against predefined criteria.
3. **Decision**: Based on the evaluation, deciding whether the request should be approved, reworked, or rejected.
4. **Notification**: Informing the requestor of the decision, including any reasons for rework or rejection.
5. **Resolution**: Finalizing the request process, which may involve implementing approved requests, revising reworked requests, or closing rejected requests.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in 114. Logic for Request Rework vs Rejected include:
- **Tiered Evaluation**: Using multiple levels of evaluation to assess requests, with each level applying more stringent criteria.
- **Automated Pre-Screening**: Utilizing technology to initially filter requests based on basic criteria before human evaluation.
- **Continuous Feedback**: Providing ongoing feedback to requestors throughout the evaluation process to facilitate timely corrections or improvements.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in this context include:
- **Lack of Transparency**: Failing to clearly communicate evaluation criteria or decision-making processes to requestors.
- **Inconsistent Application**: Applying evaluation criteria unevenly or changing standards without notice, leading to unfair treatment of requests.
- **Insufficient Feedback**: Not providing meaningful feedback to requestors, hindering their ability to understand or address deficiencies in their requests.
