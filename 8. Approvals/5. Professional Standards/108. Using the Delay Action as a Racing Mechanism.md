# 108. Using the Delay Action as a Racing Mechanism

Canonical documentation for 108. Using the Delay Action as a Racing Mechanism. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 108. Using the Delay Action as a Racing Mechanism exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Delay Action as a Racing Mechanism is designed to introduce a time-based competition element into workflows, allowing for the creation of racing conditions where multiple actions or processes are triggered simultaneously, with the first one to complete being deemed the winner. This mechanism addresses the need for timed competitions, prioritization of tasks based on speed of completion, and the simulation of real-world racing scenarios in a controlled environment.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
At its core, using the Delay Action as a Racing Mechanism involves setting up multiple parallel paths or actions, each with its own delay or timing mechanism. These paths are triggered at the same time, and the action that completes first is considered the winner. This concept can be applied in various contexts, including workflow automation, game development, and simulation modeling.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Delay Action | A mechanism that pauses the execution of a workflow or action for a specified period. |
| Racing Mechanism | A system or process that allows multiple actions or workflows to compete against each other based on completion time. |
| Trigger | An event or action that initiates the start of a workflow or racing mechanism. |
| Winner | The action or workflow that completes first in a racing mechanism scenario. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of using the Delay Action as a Racing Mechanism include:
- **Parallel Execution**: The ability to run multiple actions or workflows simultaneously.
- **Timing and Delay**: The use of delay mechanisms to control the timing of each action or workflow.
- **Triggering**: The event or action that starts the racing mechanism.
- **Completion Detection**: The method used to determine which action or workflow completes first.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for using the Delay Action as a Racing Mechanism involves:
1. Setting up multiple parallel paths or actions.
2. Assigning a delay or timing mechanism to each path.
3. Triggering all paths simultaneously.
4. Detecting the first path to complete.
5. Declaring the winner based on the completion detection.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns include:
- **Simple Racing**: Multiple actions with fixed delays compete to complete first.
- **Dynamic Racing**: Delays are adjusted dynamically based on performance or other factors.
- **Conditional Racing**: The racing mechanism is triggered or adjusted based on specific conditions.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns include:
- **Unbalanced Delays**: Assigning significantly different delays to actions, making the competition unfair.
- **Lack of Feedback**: Not providing clear feedback on the progress or outcome of the racing mechanism.
- **Inconsistent Triggers**: Using inconsistent or unpredictable triggers, which can affect the fairness of the competition.
