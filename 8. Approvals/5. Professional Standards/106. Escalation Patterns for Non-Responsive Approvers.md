Canonical documentation for 106. Escalation Patterns for Non-Responsive Approvers. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 106. Escalation Patterns for Non-Responsive Approvers exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 106. Escalation Patterns for Non-Responsive Approvers is to provide a standardized approach to handling situations where approvers are non-responsive, thereby ensuring that business processes and workflows are not hindered by lack of timely approval. This documentation addresses the class of problems related to approval workflow bottlenecks, delayed decision-making, and inefficient escalation procedures.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of 106. Escalation Patterns for Non-Responsive Approvers involves a systematic approach to identifying, notifying, and escalating approval requests to ensure timely decision-making. This approach considers factors such as approval deadlines, approver availability, and escalation thresholds to determine the most effective course of action.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approver | An individual or entity responsible for reviewing and approving requests |
| Escalation | The process of redirecting an approval request to an alternative approver or decision-maker |
| Non-Responsive Approver | An approver who has not responded to an approval request within a specified timeframe |
| Escalation Threshold | The timeframe or conditions under which an approval request is escalated to an alternative approver |
| Approval Workflow | A series of steps involved in the approval process, including submission, review, and decision-making |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 106. Escalation Patterns for Non-Responsive Approvers include:
* Identifying non-responsive approvers and detecting approval workflow bottlenecks
* Notifying approvers and stakeholders of pending approval requests and potential escalation
* Escalating approval requests to alternative approvers or decision-makers based on predefined thresholds and criteria
* Ensuring transparency and auditability of escalation procedures and decisions

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 106. Escalation Patterns for Non-Responsive Approvers involves a tiered escalation approach, where approval requests are redirected to increasingly higher-level approvers or decision-makers based on predefined thresholds and criteria. This model typically includes:
* Initial approval request submission and notification
* First-level escalation to an alternative approver or team lead
* Second-level escalation to a department manager or director
* Final-level escalation to an executive or emergency decision-maker

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for 106. Escalation Patterns for Non-Responsive Approvers include:
* Automated notification and reminders to approvers and stakeholders
* Regular review and update of approval workflows and escalation procedures
* Use of escalation matrices or decision trees to determine the most effective course of action
* Implementation of service-level agreements (SLAs) to ensure timely approval and escalation

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for 106. Escalation Patterns for Non-Responsive Approvers include:
* Lack of clear escalation procedures or thresholds
* Insufficient notification and communication to approvers and stakeholders
* Inconsistent or ad-hoc escalation decisions
* Failure to review and update approval workflows and escalation procedures regularly
