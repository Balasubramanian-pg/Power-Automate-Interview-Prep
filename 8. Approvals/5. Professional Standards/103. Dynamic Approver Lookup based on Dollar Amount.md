> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 103. Dynamic Approver Lookup based on Dollar Amount exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Dynamic Approver Lookup based on Dollar Amount exists to streamline and automate the approval process for financial transactions, ensuring that requests are routed to the appropriate approvers based on the dollar amount of the transaction. This functionality addresses the problem of manual approver assignment, which can be time-consuming, prone to errors, and may lead to delays in the approval process. By dynamically assigning approvers based on the transaction amount, organizations can improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance compliance with financial regulations.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Dynamic Approver Lookup based on Dollar Amount is a rules-based system that evaluates the dollar amount of a financial transaction and assigns it to a designated approver or group of approvers. The system uses a predefined set of rules, which map specific dollar amount ranges to corresponding approvers. This approach enables organizations to establish a clear and consistent approval process, ensuring that transactions are properly reviewed and authorized.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Dynamic Approver Lookup based on Dollar Amount include:
* **Approver Assignment**: The process of assigning a financial transaction to a designated approver or group of approvers based on the dollar amount of the transaction.
* **Dollar Amount Ranges**: Predefined ranges of dollar amounts that determine the assignment of an approver or group of approvers.
* **Rule-Based System**: A system that uses a predefined set of rules to evaluate the dollar amount of a financial transaction and assign it to a designated approver or group of approvers.
* **Transaction Evaluation**: The process of evaluating the dollar amount of a financial transaction to determine the appropriate approver or group of approvers.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the Dynamic Approver Lookup based on Dollar Amount involves the following components:
* **Transaction Initiation**: A financial transaction is initiated, and the dollar amount is captured.
* **Rule Evaluation**: The dollar amount of the transaction is evaluated against a predefined set of rules to determine the appropriate approver or group of approvers.
* **Approver Assignment**: The transaction is assigned to the designated approver or group of approvers based on the rule evaluation.
* **Approval Process**: The assigned approver or group of approvers reviews and authorizes the transaction.

* **Tiered Approval**: Transactions are assigned to approvers based on the dollar amount, with higher amounts requiring approval from more senior personnel.
* **Multiple Approver Levels**: Transactions are assigned to multiple approvers, with each level requiring approval before the transaction is fully authorized.
* **Escalation Procedures**: Transactions that exceed a certain dollar amount or require special approval are escalated to a higher-level approver or committee.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for the Dynamic Approver Lookup based on Dollar Amount include:
* **Manual Approver Assignment**: Assigning approvers manually, which can lead to errors and delays.
* **Lack of Clear Rules**: Failing to establish clear and consistent rules for approver assignment, leading to confusion and inconsistencies.
