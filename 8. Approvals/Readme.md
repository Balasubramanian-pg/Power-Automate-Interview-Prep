# The Ultimate Masterclass on Power Automate Approvals

## Part 1: The Conceptual Foundation - Human-in-the-Loop Automation

### Introduction: Why Approvals Are a Special Class of Automation

*   Most automation is designed to remove human intervention. Power Automate Approvals are different. Their entire purpose is to gracefully **inject a formal "human-in-the-loop" decision point** into an otherwise automated process.
*   Before the Approvals connector, "approval processes" were often a messy combination of emails with `Send an email with options`, complex state machines using SharePoint columns, and brittle logic. It was difficult to track, audit, and manage.
*   The **Approvals connector** is a purpose-built, first-class service within the Power Platform designed to solve this problem. It provides a robust, centralized, and user-friendly framework for creating, managing, and tracking formal business approvals.
*   It is more than just a single action; it's a complete subsystem that integrates deeply with **Microsoft Teams, Outlook, and the Power Automate portal**, meeting users where they already work to provide a seamless approval experience. Mastering this connector is essential for automating any business process that requires managerial sign-off, compliance checks, or formal consensus.

### The Approval Lifecycle: A State Machine

*   Every approval you create is an object that moves through a distinct lifecycle, managed by the Approvals service. Understanding this flow is key to building reliable workflows.

1.  **Initiation (Flow Action):** Your Power Automate flow, using an action like `Start and wait for an approval`, makes a request to the Approvals service. It packages up all the necessary information—who needs to approve, what they are approving, and any supporting details—and sends it off.
2.  **Assignment (User Notification):** The Approvals service takes over.
    *   It creates a new, pending approval record in a hidden Dataverse environment that backs the service.
    *   It sends notifications to the assigned approvers. These are not just standard emails; they are rich, actionable messages in Outlook and adaptive cards in Teams.
    *   It sends a notification to the Power Automate mobile app.
3.  **Flow Pauses (The Waiting Game):** This is a critical and unique feature. Actions like `Start and wait for an approval` are **long-running**. Once the approval is initiated, your flow enters a "paused" or "waiting" state. It can remain in this state for up to 30 days, consuming no resources while it waits for human input.
4.  **User Action (Decision):** The approver, within Teams or Outlook, reviews the information. They can add comments and then click a button like "Approve" or "Reject." This action sends a response back to the Approvals service.
5.  **Completion & Data Collection:** The Approvals service receives the response.
    *   It records the decision, the responder's identity, their comments, and a timestamp.
    *   If it was a multi-person approval, it checks if the criteria for completion have been met (e.g., did everyone respond? Did the first person respond?).
6.  **Flow Resumes (Automation Continues):** Once the approval is complete, the Approvals service sends a signal back to your paused Power Automate flow. The flow "wakes up," and the `Start and wait for an approval` action finishes its execution, providing a rich set of **outputs** (like the `Outcome` and `Responses`) to the rest of the flow.
7.  **Post-Approval Logic:** The flow now continues, using a `Condition` or `Switch` action to check the `Outcome` and execute the appropriate downstream logic (e.g., move the file, update the status, send a notification).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The beauty of this system is its robustness and decoupling. Even if the Power Automate service were to restart while a flow is paused, the state is preserved in the Approvals service. When the flow engine comes back online, it knows it's still waiting for that specific approval to complete.

### Where Approvals Live: The User Experience

*   Approvals are designed to be multi-faceted, appearing in several places to ensure they are not missed.
*   **In Microsoft Teams:** This is the premier experience. Approvals show up in the "Activity" feed and have a dedicated "Approvals" app that can be pinned to the left rail. This app provides a central dashboard for a user to see all approvals they have sent and all that are pending their response. They can approve or reject directly from within Teams.
*   **In Outlook:** Approvers receive an "actionable message." This is not a standard email; it has the approval buttons and a comment box embedded directly in the body of the email. A user can approve or reject without ever leaving their inbox.
*   **In the Power Automate Portal:** The "Action Items > Approvals" section of the portal provides the same centralized dashboard as the Teams app.

## Part 2: The Core Actions - Building an Approval Workflow

### Action 1: `Start and wait for an approval` - The All-in-One Workhorse

*   This is the action you will use for 95% of your approval scenarios. Its name perfectly describes its behavior: it initiates the approval process and then pauses the flow until a final decision is made.

#### Deep Dive into the `Start and wait for an approval` Fields

*   **1. `Approval Type` (The Most Important Choice):** This dropdown defines the rules of the approval process when multiple approvers are involved.

    *   **Approve/Reject - Everyone must approve:**
        *   The process is sent to all approvers in parallel.
        *   The `Outcome` is only "Approve" if **every single approver** clicks "Approve."
        *   If even **one person** clicks "Reject," the entire approval is immediately completed with an `Outcome` of "Reject," and the flow continues. The other approvers are notified that the request was cancelled.
        *   **Use Case:** High-stakes decisions requiring unanimous consent, like a major budget allocation or a final legal sign-off.

    *   **Approve/Reject - First to respond:**
        *   The process is sent to all approvers in parallel.
        *   The moment the **very first person** responds (either with "Approve" or "Reject"), their decision becomes the final `Outcome`.
        *   The approval is immediately completed, and the task is removed from the other approvers' queues.
        *   **Use Case:** Scenarios where any member of a team is authorized to make a decision, like an IT support team approving a software installation or a group of managers approving a small expense.

    *   **Custom Responses - Wait for all responses:**
        *   You define your own button options (e.g., "Proceed," "Send back for Rework," "Escalate").
        *   The flow pauses until **every single approver** has selected one of the custom options.
        *   **Output:** The final `Outcome` is not useful here. Instead, you get an array of `Responses` that you must loop through to see how each person voted.
        *   **Use Case:** Formal voting or polling scenarios where you need to collect a specific response from everyone.

    *   **Custom Responses - Wait for one response:**
        *   You define your own button options.
        *   The flow continues as soon as the **first person** responds.
        *   The `Outcome` will be the custom response that the first person selected.
        *   **Use Case:** A quick poll or request where you just need the first available person from a team to take an action.

*   **2. `Title` (Required):** The title of the approval. This is the headline the user sees in Teams and Outlook. It should be concise and clear. Use dynamic content!
    *   *Good Example:* `Approval requested for new hardware: @{triggerBody()?['DeviceType']}`
    *   *Bad Example:* `Approval`

*   **3. `Assigned To` (Required):** The email address(es) of the approver(s).
    *   For multiple approvers, separate their email addresses with a **semicolon (`;`)**.
    *   This field is perfect for dynamic content, like the `Mail` property from an `Office 365 Users - Get manager (V2)` action.

*   **4. `Details` (Optional but Crucial):** The body of the approval request.
    *   This field supports **Markdown**, allowing you to format your text with headings, bolding, italics, bullet points, and links for readability.
    *   **Best Practice:** Pack this field with all the information the approver needs to make an informed decision without having to hunt for it. Include data from your trigger, links to relevant items, and clear context. A good `Details` section dramatically speeds up approval times.

*   **5. `Item Link` & `Item Link Description` (Crucial for Usability):**
    *   `Item Link`: Provide a direct URL to the item being approved (e.g., the link to the SharePoint document, the link to the Dataverse record).
    *   `Item Link Description`: A friendly name for the link (e.g., "View the full project proposal here").
    *   **Result:** This creates a prominent, clickable button on the approval card that takes the user directly to the source of truth, which is a massive user experience win.

### Handling the Approval Outputs: Using a `Condition` or `Switch`

*   The `Start and wait for an approval` action is almost always followed immediately by a control action to handle the result.

*   **The Key Output:** The `Outcome` field. This single string value contains the final result of the approval ("Approve" or "Reject" for the standard types).
*   **The Pattern with a `Condition` (for Approve/Reject):**
    1.  `Condition` action.
    2.  **Left Value:** The `Outcome` dynamic content from the approval action.
    3.  **Operator:** `is equal to`
    4.  **Right Value:** `Approve`
    5.  The `If yes` branch contains your approval logic (e.g., `Update item` status to 'Approved').
    6.  The `If no` branch contains your rejection logic.
*   **The Pattern with a `Switch` (for Custom Responses):**
    1.  `Switch` action.
    2.  **On` Field:** The `Outcome` dynamic content from the approval action (when using "Wait for one response").
    3.  Create a `Case` for each of your custom responses ("Proceed," "Rework," etc.).
    4.  Place the corresponding logic in each case block.

### Advanced Data: The `Responses` Array

*   In addition to the simple `Outcome`, the action also outputs an array named `Responses`.
*   This array contains a detailed object for **every single person** who responded to the approval. Each object includes:
    *   `responder`: An object with the responder's name and email.
    *   `responseDate`: The timestamp of their response.
    *   `comments`: The text they entered into the comments box.
    *   `response`: Their individual vote (e.g., "Approve").
*   **How to Use It:** You can use an `Apply to each` loop on the `Responses` array to aggregate comments or perform other logic.
*   **Common Use Case (Collecting Comments):**
    1.  `Initialize variable` named `varAllComments` (String).
    2.  After the approval, `Apply to each` on the `Responses` array.
    3.  Inside the loop, use `Append to string variable`: `@{item()?['responder']?['displayName']}: @{item()?['comments']}\n`
    4.  After the loop, the `varAllComments` variable contains a nicely formatted, consolidated list of all comments, which you can then save to a note field or include in a final notification email.

### Action 2 & 3: `Create an approval` and `Wait for an approval`

*   These are two separate actions that, when used together, perform the same function as `Start and wait for an approval`. They offer more flexibility for advanced parallel processing scenarios.
*   **`Create an approval`:** This action initiates the approval process and assigns it to the users. **Crucially, it does not pause the flow.** The flow continues executing the very next action immediately. This action outputs an `Approval ID`.
*   **`Wait for an approval`:** This action is placed later in your flow. Its input is the `Approval ID` from the `Create an approval` step. When the flow reaches this action, it will then pause until that specific approval is completed.

*   **When would you ever use this?**
    *   **The Parallel Branch Pattern:** Imagine you need to get an approval from the Finance department, but while you are waiting for their response, you also need to perform a series of five other independent, time-consuming API calls or data updates.
    1.  Add a `Parallel branch` control action.
    2.  **Left Branch:**
        *   `Create an approval` (for Finance). Outputs `FinanceApprovalID`.
        *   `Wait for an approval`. Input is `FinanceApprovalID`.
        *   Finance-related logic after the wait is complete.
    3.  **Right Branch:**
        *   Your series of five independent API calls.
    *   **Result:** The flow triggers the Finance approval and the five API calls **at the same time**. It will be faster because the API calls don't have to wait for the human approval to be completed first. The main flow will only proceed past the parallel branch once *both* branches have completed.

### Flashcard Q&A: Core Actions & Concepts

*   **Q:** What is the critical and unique behavior of the `Start and wait for an approval` action?
*   **A:** It **pauses** the flow's execution, potentially for days, until a response is received from the assigned approver(s).

*   **Q:** You need an approval where any one of three managers can approve a request, and the first person's decision is final. Which `Approval Type` must you choose?
*   **A:** `Approve/Reject - First to respond`.

*   **Q:** You want to include a direct link to the SharePoint document being reviewed in your approval request. Which two fields in the approval action should you use?
*   **A:** `Item Link` (for the URL) and `Item Link Description` (for the friendly text).

*   **Q:** What is the primary purpose of splitting an approval into separate `Create an approval` and `Wait for an approval` actions?
*   **A:** To enable advanced **parallel processing**. It allows the flow to perform other, independent actions while the approval is pending, which can improve the overall speed of the workflow.

## Part 3: Advanced Approval Patterns and Best Practices

### Pattern 1: Dynamic and Serial Approvals

*   A common requirement is a multi-stage approval process. For example, an expense claim must first be approved by the employee's direct manager. If the amount is over $1,000, it must *then* also be approved by the department head.
*   **The Architecture (A Sequential Chain):**
    1.  **Trigger:** An expense claim is submitted.
    2.  **Action (Office 365 Users):** `Get manager (V2)`. Input is the requester's email. This finds their direct manager.
    3.  **Action (Approvals):** `Start and wait for an approval`. `Assigned To`: The `Mail` output from the `Get manager (V2)` action. (This is **Level 1 Approval**).
    4.  **Action (`Condition`):** Checks the `Outcome` of the first approval.
    5.  **Inside the `If yes` branch (of the Level 1 Approval):**
        *   Another **`Condition`** to check the `Amount`.
        *   `Amount` is greater than `1000`.
        *   **Inside this `If yes` branch:**
            *   **Action (Office 365 Users):** `Get manager (V2)`. This time, the input is the `Mail` of the *first manager* to find *their* manager (the department head).
            *   **Action (Approvals):** `Start and wait for an approval`. `Assigned To`: The email of the second-level manager. (This is **Level 2 Approval**).
            *   Handle the outcome of the Level 2 approval inside this nested block.
    6.  Continue the logic. If any stage is rejected, you would typically update the status and notify the original requester.

### Pattern 2: Escalations and Timeouts

*   What happens if an approver is on vacation and never responds? A well-designed flow should not wait forever.
*   **The Architecture (`Parallel Branch` for a Timeout):**
    1.  Add a `Parallel branch` control action.
    2.  **Left Branch (The Main Approval Logic):**
        *   `Start and wait for an approval`.
    3.  **Right Branch (The Timeout/Escalation Logic):**
        *   `Delay` action. Configure its duration for your desired timeout period (e.g., P3D for 3 days).
        *   `Get my profile (V2)`. (Gets the flow owner).
        *   `Send an email` to the flow owner or the original approver's manager with a subject like "Approval for item XYZ is overdue." You can even include actions to reassign the task.
*   **How it Works:** The `Start and wait` and the `Delay` actions start at the same time. It's a race.
    *   If the approval is completed before the 3-day delay finishes, the flow proceeds down the left branch. By default, the flow will then automatically cancel the other running branch (the timeout branch), so the escalation email is never sent.
    *   If 3 days pass and the approval is still pending, the `Delay` action completes, and the right branch runs, sending the escalation notification.

### Pattern 3: Using State Machines for Complex Rework Loops

*   Sometimes an approver doesn't want to just reject a document; they want to send it back to the author for "rework." The author then resubmits, and it goes back to the same approver. This is a state machine.
*   **The Architecture (Using `Do until` and a SharePoint Status Column):**
    1.  **Data Source:** A SharePoint list with a `Status` column (choices: "Draft", "Pending Approval", "Approved", "Rejected").
    2.  **Trigger:** `When an item is created or modified` in SharePoint.
    3.  **Trigger Condition:** `@not(equals(triggerBody()?['Status']?['Value'], 'Draft'))` (The process only starts when a user moves it out of Draft).
    4.  **Action (`Do until` Loop):**
        *   Configure the loop to run **until** the `Status` field is equal to "Approved" or "Rejected".
    5.  **Actions Inside the Loop:**
        *   `Condition` to check if `Status` equals "Pending Approval".
        *   **If Yes:**
            *   `Start and wait for an approval`. Use "Custom Responses" with buttons for "Approve," "Reject," and "**Request Rework**."
            *   `Switch` on the `Outcome` of the approval.
            *   **Case `Approve`:** `Update item`, set `Status` to "Approved".
            *   **Case `Reject`:** `Update item`, set `Status` to "Rejected".
            *   **Case `Request Rework`:** `Update item`, set `Status` to "Draft" and post the approver's `Comments` back to a comment field on the SharePoint item.
*   **How it Works:**
    *   A user sets the status to "Pending Approval", which triggers the flow. The `Do until` loop starts.
    *   The flow sends the approval. If the approver chooses "Request Rework," the flow sets the SharePoint status back to "Draft". The `Do until` loop's condition is not met, so it continues.
    *   The original author gets a notification, sees the comments, makes their changes, and sets the SharePoint status *back* to "Pending Approval".
    *   This modification re-triggers the flow, which now enters the *second iteration* of the `Do until` loop, sending it for approval again.
    *   This continues until the approver finally chooses "Approve" or "Reject", which changes the status and allows the `Do until` loop to exit.

### Flashcard Q&A: Advanced Patterns

*   **Q:** You need a process where a manager must approve a request first, and only if they approve and the amount is over $5,000 does it then go to a Director for a second approval. What is this pattern called?
*   **A:** A **Serial Approval** pattern.

*   **Q:** How can you build a timeout into an approval process to handle cases where an approver doesn't respond in a timely manner?
*   **A:** Use a **`Parallel branch`** control action. One branch contains the `Start and wait for an approval` action, and the other branch contains a `Delay` action followed by your escalation logic (e.g., send a reminder email).

*   **Q:** What is the most robust way to handle a complex "rework" loop where an item might go back and forth between an author and an approver multiple times?
*   **A:** A **State Machine** pattern, typically built using a `Do until` loop that checks a `Status` column in a data source like SharePoint or Dataverse.
