> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 100. Comparing Start and Wait vs Split Actions Efficiency exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of comparing Start and Wait vs Split Actions Efficiency is to evaluate and optimize the performance of concurrent systems, particularly in scenarios where multiple tasks or actions need to be executed simultaneously. This comparison exists to address the class of problems related to efficient task management, resource allocation, and synchronization in concurrent systems. The primary problem space includes scenarios where tasks have dependencies, require exclusive access to shared resources, or need to be executed in a specific order.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of comparing Start and Wait vs Split Actions Efficiency involves understanding the fundamental differences between these two approaches. Start and Wait refers to a sequential execution model where tasks are started and then waited upon to complete before proceeding to the next task. In contrast, Split Actions involve dividing tasks into smaller, independent sub-tasks that can be executed concurrently. This high-level model considers factors such as task dependencies, resource utilization, and synchronization mechanisms to determine the most efficient approach for a given scenario.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Start and Wait | A sequential execution model where tasks are started and then waited upon to complete before proceeding to the next task. |
| Split Actions | An approach to divide tasks into smaller, independent sub-tasks that can be executed concurrently. |
| Task Dependency | A relationship between tasks where the execution of one task depends on the completion or output of another task. |
| Resource Utilization | The extent to which system resources, such as CPU, memory, or I/O devices, are being used to execute tasks. |
| Synchronization Mechanism | A technique or protocol used to coordinate access to shared resources, ensuring that tasks execute in a consistent and predictable manner. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of comparing Start and Wait vs Split Actions Efficiency include understanding task dependencies, resource utilization, and synchronization mechanisms. Task dependencies are crucial in determining the order of task execution, while resource utilization affects the overall system performance. Synchronization mechanisms, such as locks, semaphores, or monitors, are used to manage access to shared resources and prevent conflicts between concurrent tasks. Additionally, the concept of concurrency and parallelism is essential, as it enables the execution of multiple tasks simultaneously, improving system responsiveness and throughput.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for comparing Start and Wait vs Split Actions Efficiency involves a hybrid approach that combines the benefits of both sequential and concurrent execution. This model recommends using Start and Wait for tasks with strong dependencies or those that require exclusive access to shared resources. In contrast, Split Actions are suitable for tasks with minimal dependencies or those that can be executed independently. The model also emphasizes the importance of synchronization mechanisms and resource utilization monitoring to ensure efficient and predictable system behavior.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in comparing Start and Wait vs Split Actions Efficiency include:
* Using Start and Wait for tasks with strong dependencies or exclusive resource access
* Applying Split Actions for tasks with minimal dependencies or independent execution
* Implementing synchronization mechanisms, such as locks or semaphores, to manage shared resources
* Monitoring resource utilization to optimize system performance
* Using concurrency and parallelism to improve system responsiveness and throughput

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in comparing Start and Wait vs Split Actions Efficiency include:
* Using Start and Wait for tasks with minimal dependencies, leading to underutilization of system resources
* Applying Split Actions to tasks with strong dependencies, resulting in conflicts or inconsistencies
* Neglecting synchronization mechanisms, causing data corruption or system crashes
* Ignoring resource utilization, leading to performance degradation or system overload
* Overusing concurrency and parallelism, resulting in increased complexity or decreased maintainability
