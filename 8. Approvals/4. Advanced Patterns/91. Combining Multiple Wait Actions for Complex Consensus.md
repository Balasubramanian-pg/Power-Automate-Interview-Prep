> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 91. Combining Multiple Wait Actions for Complex Consensus exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of combining multiple wait actions for complex consensus is to enable the coordination of distributed systems, ensuring that all components agree on a single state or decision. This is particularly important in systems where data consistency and integrity are crucial, such as financial transactions, voting systems, or distributed databases. The problem space addressed by this topic includes scenarios where multiple parties or nodes need to reach a consensus, and the wait actions are used to synchronize their actions and ensure a consistent outcome.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of combining multiple wait actions for complex consensus involves a set of nodes or parties that need to agree on a decision or state. Each node may have its own wait action, which is a mechanism to delay or pause its execution until a certain condition is met. By combining these wait actions, the nodes can coordinate their actions and ensure that all parties agree on the outcome. This model relies on the principles of distributed consensus protocols, such as leader election, voting, or Byzantine fault tolerance.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Consensus | A state where all nodes or parties agree on a single decision or state. |
| Wait Action | A mechanism to delay or pause the execution of a node until a certain condition is met. |
| Distributed System | A system composed of multiple nodes or parties that communicate and coordinate with each other. |
| Node | A component or party in a distributed system that participates in the consensus protocol. |
| Leader Election | A protocol used to select a leader node that coordinates the consensus process. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of combining multiple wait actions for complex consensus include:
* **Distributed consensus protocols**: These protocols enable nodes to agree on a single decision or state, despite failures or inconsistencies.
* **Wait action synchronization**: This refers to the mechanism of coordinating wait actions across multiple nodes to ensure a consistent outcome.
* **Leader election**: This is a protocol used to select a leader node that coordinates the consensus process.
* **Fault tolerance**: This refers to the ability of the system to continue functioning even if one or more nodes fail or behave incorrectly.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for combining multiple wait actions for complex consensus involves the following components:
* **Node initialization**: Each node initializes its wait action and communicates with other nodes to establish a consensus protocol.
* **Leader election**: A leader node is elected to coordinate the consensus process.
* **Wait action synchronization**: The leader node synchronizes the wait actions of all nodes to ensure a consistent outcome.
* **Consensus decision**: The nodes agree on a decision or state, and the wait actions are released.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for combining multiple wait actions for complex consensus include:
* **Leader-based consensus**: A leader node coordinates the consensus process, and the other nodes follow its instructions.
* **Voting-based consensus**: Nodes vote on a decision or state, and the outcome is determined by a majority or consensus.
* **Byzantine fault tolerance**: The system is designed to tolerate nodes that behave incorrectly or maliciously.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for combining multiple wait actions for complex consensus include:
* **Uncoordinated wait actions**: Nodes use wait actions without coordinating with each other, leading to inconsistent outcomes.
* **Single point of failure**: The system relies on a single node or component, which can lead to failures or inconsistencies if it fails.
* **Lack of fault tolerance**: The system is not designed to tolerate failures or inconsistencies, leading to incorrect or inconsistent outcomes.
