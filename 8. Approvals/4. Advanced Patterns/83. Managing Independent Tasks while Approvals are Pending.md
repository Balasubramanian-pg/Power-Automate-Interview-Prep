Canonical documentation for 83. Managing Independent Tasks while Approvals are Pending. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 83. Managing Independent Tasks while Approvals are Pending exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of managing independent tasks while approvals are pending is to ensure that business processes and workflows continue to operate efficiently, even when certain tasks are awaiting approval. This addresses the class of problems related to workflow bottlenecks, delayed task completion, and reduced productivity. By managing independent tasks effectively, organizations can minimize the impact of pending approvals and maintain a smooth workflow.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of managing independent tasks while approvals are pending involves understanding the relationships between tasks, approvals, and workflows. It requires identifying independent tasks that can be executed concurrently with pending approvals, prioritizing tasks based on their urgency and importance, and allocating resources efficiently to ensure timely completion.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Independent Task | A task that can be executed without relying on the outcome of a pending approval |
| Pending Approval | An approval that is awaiting a decision or response |
| Workflow | A series of tasks and approvals that are interconnected to achieve a specific business objective |
| Task Prioritization | The process of assigning priority levels to tasks based on their urgency and importance |
| Resource Allocation | The process of assigning resources, such as personnel or equipment, to tasks to ensure their timely completion |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of managing independent tasks while approvals are pending include:
* Identifying independent tasks that can be executed concurrently with pending approvals
* Prioritizing tasks based on their urgency and importance
* Allocating resources efficiently to ensure timely completion
* Monitoring and tracking the status of pending approvals and independent tasks
* Adjusting workflows and task assignments as needed to minimize delays and optimize productivity

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for managing independent tasks while approvals are pending involves the following steps:
1. Identify independent tasks that can be executed concurrently with pending approvals
2. Prioritize tasks based on their urgency and importance
3. Allocate resources efficiently to ensure timely completion
4. Monitor and track the status of pending approvals and independent tasks
5. Adjust workflows and task assignments as needed to minimize delays and optimize productivity

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for managing independent tasks while approvals are pending include:
* Using parallel processing to execute independent tasks concurrently with pending approvals
* Implementing a task prioritization framework to ensure that urgent and important tasks are completed promptly
* Allocating resources dynamically to ensure that tasks are completed efficiently
* Using workflow automation tools to streamline workflows and reduce manual errors

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for managing independent tasks while approvals are pending include:
* Waiting for pending approvals to be resolved before executing independent tasks
* Assigning tasks to resources without considering their availability or workload
* Failing to monitor and track the status of pending approvals and independent tasks
* Not adjusting workflows and task assignments in response to changes in pending approvals or task priorities
