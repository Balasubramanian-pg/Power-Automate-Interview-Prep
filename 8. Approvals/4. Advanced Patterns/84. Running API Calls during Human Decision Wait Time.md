Canonical documentation for 84. Running API Calls during Human Decision Wait Time. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 84. Running API Calls during Human Decision Wait Time exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of running API calls during human decision wait time is to optimize the efficiency of workflows that involve both automated and manual decision-making processes. This approach addresses the problem of idle time in workflows where human intervention is required, allowing for the utilization of wait time to execute API calls that can run in parallel, thus improving overall process efficiency and reducing cycle time.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model involves integrating API calls into workflows at points where human decision-making introduces wait times. This integration enables the execution of automated tasks that do not require human input, leveraging the idle time to enhance productivity. The model encompasses identifying wait times, selecting appropriate API calls, ensuring data consistency, and managing the asynchronous execution of these calls.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Asynchronous Processing | A method of processing where tasks are executed independently without blocking the main workflow, allowing for parallel execution. |
| Human Decision Wait Time | The period in a workflow where the process is paused awaiting human input or decision. |
| API Call | A request to an Application Programming Interface to perform a specific function or retrieve data. |
| Workflow Optimization | The process of analyzing and improving workflows to maximize efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance productivity. |
| Parallel Execution | The ability to execute multiple tasks or processes simultaneously, improving overall processing speed and efficiency. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts include identifying opportunities for parallel processing within workflows, understanding the nature of human decision wait times, and the capability to integrate API calls seamlessly into these workflows. Additionally, managing data consistency and handling potential errors or exceptions that may arise from asynchronous API calls are crucial.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for running API calls during human decision wait time involves a workflow management system that can identify wait times, an API gateway or service layer to manage API calls, and a data management system to ensure data integrity and consistency. The model also includes monitoring and logging mechanisms to track the execution of API calls and handle any exceptions.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns include using message queues or job scheduling systems to manage the execution of API calls during wait times, implementing retry mechanisms for failed API calls, and utilizing caching to reduce the load on APIs and improve response times.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns include executing API calls synchronously within workflows, failing to implement error handling for API calls, and not monitoring the performance and latency of API calls executed during wait times.
