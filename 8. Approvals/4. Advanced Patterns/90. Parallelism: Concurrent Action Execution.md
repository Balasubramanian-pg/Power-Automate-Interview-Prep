# 90. Parallelism: Concurrent Action Execution

Canonical documentation for 90. Parallelism: Concurrent Action Execution. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 90. Parallelism: Concurrent Action Execution exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of parallelism is to enable concurrent action execution, allowing multiple tasks to be performed simultaneously, thereby improving overall system efficiency, responsiveness, and throughput. This approach addresses the problem of sequential execution, where tasks are performed one after the other, leading to underutilization of system resources and potential bottlenecks. By executing actions in parallel, systems can better utilize multi-core processors, reduce processing times, and enhance user experience.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Parallelism involves dividing tasks into smaller, independent sub-tasks that can be executed concurrently by multiple processing units, such as CPU cores or threads. This allows for the simultaneous execution of multiple actions, maximizing system resource utilization and minimizing idle time. The conceptual model of parallelism encompasses the coordination of these concurrent actions, ensuring data consistency, synchronization, and proper communication between tasks.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Parallelism | The ability of a system to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, improving overall efficiency and responsiveness. |
| Concurrency | The ability of a system to perform multiple tasks in overlapping time periods, while not necessarily executing them simultaneously. |
| Thread | A separate flow of execution within a process, allowing for concurrent execution of tasks. |
| Process | An independent unit of execution, comprising its own memory space and resources. |
| Synchronization | The coordination of access to shared resources, ensuring data consistency and preventing conflicts between concurrent tasks. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of parallelism include:
* **Task decomposition**: Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, independent sub-tasks that can be executed concurrently.
* **Thread management**: Creating, scheduling, and managing threads to execute tasks in parallel.
* **Synchronization**: Coordinating access to shared resources, ensuring data consistency and preventing conflicts between concurrent tasks.
* **Communication**: Exchanging data between tasks, enabling cooperation and coordination between concurrent actions.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for parallelism involves:
1. **Task queueing**: Submitting tasks to a queue, where they are scheduled for execution.
2. **Thread pooling**: Managing a pool of threads, which execute tasks from the queue.
3. **Synchronization primitives**: Using locks, semaphores, or other synchronization mechanisms to coordinate access to shared resources.
4. **Result aggregation**: Combining the results of concurrent tasks, ensuring a consistent and accurate outcome.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in parallelism include:
* **Data parallelism**: Executing the same task on different data elements concurrently.
* **Task parallelism**: Executing different tasks concurrently, improving overall system throughput.
* **Pipelining**: Breaking down a complex task into a series of stages, executing each stage concurrently.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in parallelism include:
* **Over-threading**: Creating an excessive number of threads, leading to context switching overhead and decreased performance.
* **Under-threading**: Creating too few threads, resulting in underutilization of system resources.
* **Lack of synchronization**: Failing to coordinate access to shared resources, leading to data inconsistencies and conflicts.
