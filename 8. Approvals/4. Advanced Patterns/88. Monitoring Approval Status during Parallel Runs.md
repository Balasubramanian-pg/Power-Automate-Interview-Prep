# 88. Monitoring Approval Status during Parallel Runs

Canonical documentation for 88. Monitoring Approval Status during Parallel Runs. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 88. Monitoring Approval Status during Parallel Runs exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of monitoring approval status during parallel runs is to ensure that multiple processes or workflows can operate concurrently without conflicts or inconsistencies. This is particularly important in environments where multiple stakeholders or teams need to review, approve, or reject changes, updates, or new implementations. The class of problems it addresses includes synchronization issues, approval bottlenecks, and the need for real-time visibility into the status of parallel processes.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Monitoring approval status during parallel runs involves tracking the progress and approval state of multiple workflows or processes as they execute simultaneously. This requires a system or mechanism that can handle concurrent updates, provide real-time feedback, and ensure data consistency across all parallel runs. The conceptual model includes components such as workflow management, approval tracking, and real-time notification systems.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Parallel Run | The simultaneous execution of multiple workflows or processes. |
| Approval Status | The current state of approval for a particular workflow or process, which can be pending, approved, rejected, or in-progress. |
| Workflow Management | The process of designing, executing, and monitoring workflows, including the management of approvals and rejections. |
| Real-time Notification | The immediate notification of stakeholders or teams regarding changes in approval status or other significant events during parallel runs. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of monitoring approval status during parallel runs include:
- **Concurrency Control**: Mechanisms to manage and synchronize access to shared resources or data to prevent conflicts during parallel execution.
- **Approval Workflow**: Defined processes that outline the steps and stakeholders involved in approving or rejecting changes or updates.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: The ability to track and display the current status of all parallel runs in real-time, enabling prompt action in response to changes or issues.
- **Scalability**: The capacity of the system to handle an increasing number of parallel runs without compromising performance or data integrity.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for monitoring approval status during parallel runs typically involves:
1. **Initialization**: Setting up workflows and defining approval processes.
2. **Execution**: Starting parallel runs and tracking their progress.
3. **Approval Tracking**: Monitoring and updating the approval status of each run in real-time.
4. **Notification**: Sending real-time notifications upon changes in approval status or completion of runs.
5. **Analysis**: Reviewing outcomes and identifying areas for improvement.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns include:
- **Centralized Approval Hub**: A single platform or system that manages all approval workflows and statuses.
- **Distributed Approval**: Approval processes are distributed across different teams or stakeholders, with a centralized system for tracking overall status.
- **Automated Approval**: Using predefined rules to automatically approve or reject certain changes, with human oversight for complex decisions.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns to avoid include:
- **Manual Tracking**: Relying on manual methods (e.g., spreadsheets, email) to track approval status, which can lead to errors and inefficiencies.
- **Lack of Real-time Feedback**: Failing to provide immediate updates on approval status changes, leading to delays and misunderstandings.
- **Insufficient Scalability Planning**: Not considering the potential for increased parallel runs, resulting in system overload and performance issues.
