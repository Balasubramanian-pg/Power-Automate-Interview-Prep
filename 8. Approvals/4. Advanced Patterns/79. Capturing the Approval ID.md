# 79. Capturing the Approval ID

Canonical documentation for 79. Capturing the Approval ID. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 79. Capturing the Approval ID exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of capturing the Approval ID is to provide a unique identifier for tracking and verifying the approval status of a particular process or transaction. This addresses the problem of ensuring that approvals are properly documented and can be easily referenced or audited. The class of problems it addresses includes issues related to approval tracking, verification, and auditing, particularly in scenarios where multiple approvals are required or where approvals need to be traced for compliance or regulatory purposes.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Capturing the Approval ID involves generating, storing, and managing a unique identifier that corresponds to a specific approval event. This identifier can then be used to link related data, such as the approval request, the approver's decision, and any subsequent actions taken as a result of the approval. The conceptual model includes the approval request, the approval process, the approval decision, and the storage and management of the Approval ID.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approval ID | A unique identifier assigned to a specific approval event. |
| Approval Request | A formal request for approval, which may include relevant details such as the purpose of the request, the items or actions requiring approval, and the deadline for the approval decision. |
| Approval Process | The series of steps or stages involved in obtaining approval, which may include submission, review, decision-making, and notification. |
| Approver | The individual or entity responsible for making the approval decision. |
| Approval Decision | The outcome of the approval process, which may be either approval, rejection, or a request for additional information. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of capturing the Approval ID include uniqueness, persistence, and traceability. Uniqueness ensures that each Approval ID is distinct and not duplicated. Persistence refers to the ability to store and retain the Approval ID over time, even after the initial approval event has been completed. Traceability involves the ability to track and link all related data and events using the Approval ID, facilitating auditing and compliance.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for capturing the Approval ID typically involves the following steps: 
1. **Generation**: A unique Approval ID is generated when an approval request is submitted.
2. **Assignment**: The Approval ID is assigned to the approval request and all related data.
3. **Storage**: The Approval ID, along with relevant approval details, is stored in a database or repository.
4. **Management**: The Approval ID is managed to ensure its integrity, security, and accessibility for future reference or auditing.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in capturing the Approval ID include using UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) or GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers) for generating unique Approval IDs, integrating approval processes with workflow management systems, and implementing role-based access control to ensure that only authorized personnel can view or modify approval details associated with an Approval ID.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in capturing the Approval ID include using non-unique or predictable identifiers, failing to securely store Approval IDs and related data, neglecting to implement audit trails or version control for approval decisions, and not providing clear guidelines or training for approvers and other stakeholders involved in the approval process.
