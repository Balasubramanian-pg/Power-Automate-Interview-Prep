> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 76. Why Split Approvals into Create and Wait exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of splitting approvals into create and wait is to improve the efficiency and transparency of approval processes. This approach addresses the class of problems related to manual approval workflows, where a single approval step can become a bottleneck, leading to delays and inefficiencies. By splitting approvals into create and wait, organizations can streamline their approval processes, reduce the risk of errors, and increase productivity.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of splitting approvals into create and wait involves a two-stage process. The first stage, "create," refers to the initiation of an approval request, where the request is created and submitted for review. The second stage, "wait," refers to the period of time where the approval request is pending, awaiting review and approval by the designated approver. This two-stage process allows for a clear separation of duties, improved tracking and monitoring, and enhanced visibility into the approval process.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approval Request | A formal request for approval, typically submitted by an initiator |
| Approver | An individual or group responsible for reviewing and approving an approval request |
| Create Stage | The initial stage of the approval process, where the approval request is created and submitted |
| Wait Stage | The secondary stage of the approval process, where the approval request is pending, awaiting review and approval |
| Initiator | The individual or group responsible for initiating an approval request |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of splitting approvals into create and wait include:
* Separation of duties: The create and wait stages allow for a clear separation of duties, ensuring that the initiator and approver have distinct roles and responsibilities.
* Improved tracking and monitoring: The two-stage process enables real-time tracking and monitoring of approval requests, reducing the risk of lost or misplaced requests.
* Enhanced visibility: The create and wait stages provide enhanced visibility into the approval process, allowing stakeholders to view the status of approval requests and anticipate potential delays.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for splitting approvals into create and wait involves the following steps:
1. Initiation: The initiator creates an approval request and submits it for review.
2. Creation: The approval request is created and assigned a unique identifier.
3. Submission: The approval request is submitted to the approver for review.
4. Waiting: The approval request is pending, awaiting review and approval by the approver.
5. Approval: The approver reviews and approves the approval request.
6. Notification: The initiator and other stakeholders are notified of the approval decision.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for splitting approvals into create and wait include:
* Using workflow management tools to automate the approval process
* Implementing role-based access control to ensure that only authorized individuals can create and approve requests
* Establishing clear service level agreements (SLAs) for approval requests to ensure timely processing

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for splitting approvals into create and wait include:
* Using a single-stage approval process, where the create and wait stages are combined
* Failing to establish clear roles and responsibilities for initiators and approvers
* Not providing real-time tracking and monitoring of approval requests
