# 81. Reconnecting Wait to Create via Approval ID

Canonical documentation for 81. Reconnecting Wait to Create via Approval ID. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 81. Reconnecting Wait to Create via Approval ID exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Reconnecting Wait to Create via Approval ID feature exists to address the issue of lost or disconnected approval requests in automated workflows. This occurs when an approval request is generated but not properly linked to its corresponding wait state, resulting in delays or failures in the workflow. The purpose of this feature is to provide a mechanism for reconnecting these lost approval requests, ensuring that workflows can proceed efficiently and without interruption.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Reconnecting Wait to Create via Approval ID feature operates by leveraging a unique identifier, known as the Approval ID, to reconnect disconnected approval requests with their corresponding wait states. This process involves querying the system for approval requests that are in a pending state, identifying those that have become disconnected, and then reestablishing the link between the approval request and its wait state using the Approval ID.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approval ID | A unique identifier assigned to each approval request, used for tracking and reconnecting purposes. |
| Wait State | A temporary state in a workflow where the process is paused, awaiting approval or another condition to be met. |
| Approval Request | A formal request for approval, typically generated automatically within a workflow. |
| Reconnection | The process of reestablishing the link between an approval request and its corresponding wait state. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Reconnecting Wait to Create via Approval ID include the use of unique identifiers (Approval IDs) for tracking and reconnecting approval requests, the existence of wait states in workflows, and the necessity of reconnection mechanisms to prevent workflow interruptions. Understanding these concepts is crucial for implementing and managing approval workflows efficiently.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Reconnecting Wait to Create via Approval ID involves the following steps: 
1. Generation of an approval request with a unique Approval ID.
2. The approval request is sent for approval.
3. If the approval request becomes disconnected from its wait state, the system queries for pending approvals using the Approval ID.
4. Upon identification, the system reconnects the approval request with its wait state.
5. The workflow proceeds based on the outcome of the approval request.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns include automated approval workflows, manual approval processes with notifications, and integration with external approval systems. These patterns often involve the use of Approval IDs for tracking and reconnection purposes, ensuring that workflows can adapt to various approval scenarios.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns include not using unique identifiers for approval requests, failing to implement reconnection mechanisms, and not providing clear notifications or updates during the approval process. These practices can lead to inefficiencies, errors, and significant delays in workflows.
