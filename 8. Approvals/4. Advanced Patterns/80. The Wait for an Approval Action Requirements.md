## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 80. The Wait for an Approval Action Requirements exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Wait for an Approval Action Requirements exists to provide a standardized framework for managing approval workflows in business processes. It addresses the class of problems related to inefficient approval processes, lack of transparency, and inadequate control over approval workflows. This includes issues such as delayed approvals, lost or misplaced requests, and insufficient audit trails.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The Wait for an Approval Action Requirements can be conceptualized as a state machine that manages the approval workflow. It consists of three primary states: Pending, Approved, and Rejected. The workflow transitions between these states based on user interactions, such as submitting a request, approving or rejecting a request, and canceling a pending request.

| Approval Workflow | A sequence of tasks and decisions that lead to the approval or rejection of a request. |
| Requester | The individual or entity that submits a request for approval. |
| Approver | The individual or entity responsible for reviewing and approving or rejecting a request. |
| Approval Threshold | The minimum number of approvals required for a request to be considered approved. |
