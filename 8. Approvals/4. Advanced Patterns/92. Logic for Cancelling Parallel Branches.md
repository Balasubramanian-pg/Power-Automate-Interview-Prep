> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 92. Logic for Cancelling Parallel Branches exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 92. Logic for Cancelling Parallel Branches is to provide a standardized approach to managing parallel branches in complex workflows, particularly in scenarios where cancellation of one or more branches is required. This logic addresses the class of problems related to concurrent execution, synchronization, and termination of parallel processes, ensuring that system resources are efficiently utilized and errors are minimized.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of 92. Logic for Cancelling Parallel Branches involves understanding the principles of parallel processing, where multiple branches or threads are executed concurrently to achieve a common goal. The logic for cancelling parallel branches is built around the idea of monitoring the state of each branch and making informed decisions about which branches to cancel, based on factors such as error conditions, timeouts, or changes in the overall workflow.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Parallel Branch | A separate thread or process executing concurrently with other branches to achieve a common objective. |
| Cancellation | The act of terminating a parallel branch, either due to an error, a timeout, or a change in the workflow. |
| Synchronization | The process of coordinating the execution of parallel branches to ensure that they complete in a consistent and predictable manner. |
| Workflow | A series of processes or activities designed to achieve a specific goal, which may involve parallel branches. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 92. Logic for Cancelling Parallel Branches include:
- **Branch Monitoring**: The ability to track the state of each parallel branch, including its progress, errors, and completion status.
- **Cancellation Criteria**: The set of conditions that determine when a parallel branch should be cancelled, such as error thresholds, timeouts, or changes in the workflow.
- **Synchronization Mechanisms**: The methods used to coordinate the execution of parallel branches, ensuring that they complete in a consistent and predictable manner.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 92. Logic for Cancelling Parallel Branches involves a centralized controller or coordinator that monitors the state of each parallel branch and makes decisions about which branches to cancel, based on predefined criteria. This model includes the following components:
- **Branch Controller**: Responsible for monitoring the state of each parallel branch and triggering cancellations as needed.
- **Cancellation Service**: Handles the actual cancellation of parallel branches, ensuring that system resources are released and errors are handled properly.
- **Synchronization Manager**: Coordinates the execution of parallel branches, ensuring that they complete in a consistent and predictable manner.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for 92. Logic for Cancelling Parallel Branches include:
- **Timeout Pattern**: Cancelling a parallel branch after a specified timeout period, to prevent resource starvation or deadlock.
- **Error Handling Pattern**: Cancelling a parallel branch in response to an error condition, to prevent further errors or damage to the system.
- **Workflow Change Pattern**: Cancelling a parallel branch in response to a change in the workflow, to ensure that the system remains consistent and up-to-date.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for 92. Logic for Cancelling Parallel Branches include:
- **Uncontrolled Cancellation**: Cancelling parallel branches without proper coordination or synchronization, leading to inconsistent or unpredictable behavior.
- **Over-Cancellation**: Cancelling too many parallel branches, leading to wasted resources and decreased system performance.
- **Under-Cancellation**: Failing to cancel parallel branches when necessary, leading to errors, resource starvation, or deadlock.
