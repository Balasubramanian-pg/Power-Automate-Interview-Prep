## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 78. Non-Blocking Nature of the Create Action exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Non-Blocking Nature of the Create Action is designed to address the need for efficient and scalable resource creation in systems where blocking operations can lead to performance bottlenecks and decreased responsiveness. This concept is particularly relevant in distributed systems, where the creation of resources may involve multiple nodes or services, and blocking can have a ripple effect throughout the system. By allowing create actions to be non-blocking, systems can improve their overall throughput, reduce latency, and increase user satisfaction.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Non-Blocking Nature of the Create Action can be thought of as a design pattern that enables systems to create resources without blocking the requesting thread or process. This is achieved by using asynchronous or parallel processing techniques, which allow the system to continue processing other requests while the create action is being executed. The key idea is to decouple the create action from the main thread of execution, allowing the system to maintain a high level of responsiveness and scalability.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Non-Blocking | An operation that does not block the requesting thread or process, allowing other operations to be executed concurrently. |
| Create Action | The process of creating a new resource, such as a file, object, or database record. |
| Asynchronous Processing | A technique where operations are executed in parallel, without blocking the main thread of execution. |
| Parallel Processing | A technique where multiple operations are executed simultaneously, using multiple threads or processes. |
| Scalability | The ability of a system to handle increased load or demand without a significant decrease in performance. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The Non-Blocking Nature of the Create Action is based on several core concepts, including:
* Asynchronous processing: This allows create actions to be executed in parallel, without blocking the main thread of execution.
* Parallel processing: This enables multiple create actions to be executed simultaneously, improving overall system throughput.
* Decoupling: This involves separating the create action from the main thread of execution, allowing the system to maintain a high level of responsiveness.
* Callbacks: These are used to notify the requesting thread or process when the create action is complete, allowing for asynchronous processing.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the Non-Blocking Nature of the Create Action involves the following components:
* A request handler: This receives the create request and initiates the create action.
* A worker thread or process: This executes the create action, using asynchronous or parallel processing techniques.
* A callback mechanism: This notifies the request handler when the create action is complete.
* A response handler: This returns the result of the create action to the requesting thread or process.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Several common patterns are associated with the Non-Blocking Nature of the Create Action, including:
* The Asynchronous Create Pattern: This involves using asynchronous processing to execute the create action, and notifying the requesting thread or process when complete.
* The Parallel Create Pattern: This involves using parallel processing to execute multiple create actions simultaneously.
* The Callback Pattern: This involves using callbacks to notify the requesting thread or process when the create action is complete.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Several anti-patterns are associated with the Non-Blocking Nature of the Create Action, including:
* The Blocking Create Anti-Pattern: This involves using synchronous processing to execute the create action, blocking the main thread of execution.
* The Sequential Create Anti-Pattern: This involves executing create actions sequentially, rather than in parallel.
* The Polling Anti-Pattern: This involves using polling to check the status of the create action, rather than using callbacks or other notification mechanisms.
