Canonical documentation for 89. Designing Multi-Threaded Business Processes. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 89. Designing Multi-Threaded Business Processes exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of designing multi-threaded business processes is to improve the efficiency, scalability, and responsiveness of business operations by leveraging concurrent execution of tasks. This approach addresses the problems of slow processing, limited resource utilization, and poor system responsiveness, which can lead to decreased productivity, customer dissatisfaction, and competitive disadvantage.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Designing multi-threaded business processes involves breaking down complex business operations into smaller, independent tasks that can be executed concurrently by multiple threads. This allows for better utilization of system resources, improved throughput, and enhanced responsiveness. The conceptual model consists of three primary components: (1) process decomposition, (2) thread management, and (3) synchronization and communication.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Thread | A separate flow of execution within a process, capable of executing instructions independently. |
| Process | A self-contained sequence of activities that achieve a specific business goal. |
| Synchronization | The coordination of threads to ensure data consistency and prevent conflicts. |
| Concurrency | The ability of multiple threads to execute simultaneously, improving system responsiveness and throughput. |
| Deadlock | A situation where two or more threads are blocked, each waiting for the other to release a resource. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of designing multi-threaded business processes include: (1) process decomposition, which involves breaking down complex processes into smaller, independent tasks; (2) thread management, which encompasses thread creation, scheduling, and synchronization; and (3) concurrency control, which ensures that multiple threads access shared resources safely and efficiently.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for designing multi-threaded business processes involves the following steps: (1) identify the business process to be improved; (2) decompose the process into smaller, independent tasks; (3) design a threading model that allocates tasks to threads; (4) implement synchronization and communication mechanisms; and (5) test and refine the multi-threaded process.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in designing multi-threaded business processes include: (1) the producer-consumer pattern, where one thread produces data and another thread consumes it; (2) the pipeline pattern, where multiple threads execute a sequence of tasks in a linear fashion; and (3) the worker thread pattern, where multiple threads execute tasks concurrently and independently.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in designing multi-threaded business processes include: (1) over-threading, where too many threads are created, leading to context switching overhead and decreased performance; (2) under-threading, where too few threads are created, leading to underutilization of system resources; and (3) lack of synchronization, which can lead to data inconsistencies and conflicts.
