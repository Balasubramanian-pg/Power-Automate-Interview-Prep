# 93. Handling Timeouts in Create and Wait Splits

Canonical documentation for 93. Handling Timeouts in Create and Wait Splits. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 93. Handling Timeouts in Create and Wait Splits exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of handling timeouts in create and wait splits is to manage and mitigate the risks associated with asynchronous operations that may not complete within a specified timeframe. This is particularly relevant in distributed systems, where concurrent processes or threads may be waiting for resources to become available, and timeouts can help prevent indefinite waits and resource starvation. The class of problems addressed by handling timeouts in create and wait splits includes, but is not limited to, deadlock prevention, resource utilization optimization, and system responsiveness improvement.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Handling timeouts in create and wait splits involves a conceptual framework that comprises the following key elements: 
- **Timeout specification**: defining the maximum allowable time for an operation to complete
- **Timeout detection**: identifying when an operation has exceeded its specified timeout
- **Timeout handling**: taking corrective action when a timeout is detected, such as retrying the operation, aborting it, or escalating the issue
- **Split synchronization**: coordinating the creation and waiting for splits to ensure that timeouts are properly handled and resources are not unnecessarily blocked

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Timeout | The maximum amount of time an operation is allowed to take before it is considered failed or unresponsive |
| Split | A division of a process or thread into separate, concurrent paths of execution |
| Create and Wait Split | A specific type of split where one path of execution creates a resource or initiates an operation, and another path waits for the resource to become available or the operation to complete |
| Asynchronous Operation | An operation that does not block the execution of the calling thread, allowing other tasks to be performed while waiting for the operation to complete |
| Deadlock | A situation where two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, each waiting for the other to release a resource |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts underlying handling timeouts in create and wait splits include:
- **Asynchronous programming**: writing code that can execute concurrently with other tasks, improving system responsiveness and throughput
- **Concurrency control**: managing access to shared resources in a multi-threaded or distributed environment to prevent conflicts and ensure data consistency
- **Error handling and recovery**: detecting and responding to errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of an operation, including timeouts
- **Resource management**: optimizing the use of system resources, such as memory, CPU, and I/O devices, to prevent starvation and improve overall system performance

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for handling timeouts in create and wait splits involves the following steps:
1. **Specify timeouts**: define the maximum allowable time for each operation
2. **Detect timeouts**: monitor the execution time of each operation and detect when a timeout occurs
3. **Handle timeouts**: take corrective action when a timeout is detected, such as retrying the operation or aborting it
4. **Synchronize splits**: coordinate the creation and waiting for splits to ensure that timeouts are properly handled and resources are not unnecessarily blocked

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for handling timeouts in create and wait splits include:
- **Retry pattern**: retrying an operation that has timed out, with optional exponential backoff to prevent overwhelming the system
- **Timeout escalation**: escalating a timeout to a higher-level error handler or logging mechanism for further analysis and response
- **Resource pre-allocation**: pre-allocating resources to minimize the likelihood of timeouts due to resource contention

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for handling timeouts in create and wait splits include:
- **Infinite waits**: allowing a thread or process to wait indefinitely for a resource to become available, leading to deadlock or resource starvation
- **Unbounded retries**: retrying an operation an unbounded number of times, potentially leading to resource exhaustion or system instability
- **Ignoring timeouts**: failing to detect or respond to timeouts, allowing errors to propagate and potentially causing system crashes or data corruption
