# 95. Debugging Parallel Approval Branches

Canonical documentation for 95. Debugging Parallel Approval Branches. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 95. Debugging Parallel Approval Branches exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of debugging parallel approval branches is to identify and resolve issues that arise when multiple approval processes are executed concurrently. This is particularly important in environments where multiple stakeholders are involved in the approval process, and delays or errors can have significant consequences. The class of problems addressed by debugging parallel approval branches includes synchronization issues, deadlocks, and inconsistent approval states.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Debugging parallel approval branches involves understanding the complex interactions between multiple approval processes, identifying potential bottlenecks and areas of contention, and developing strategies to mitigate these issues. This requires a deep understanding of the approval workflow, the stakeholders involved, and the potential failure points.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approval Branch | A separate path of approval within a larger workflow |
| Parallel Approval | The simultaneous execution of multiple approval branches |
| Synchronization Point | A point in the workflow where multiple approval branches converge |
| Deadlock | A situation where two or more approval branches are blocked, waiting for each other to complete |
| Approval State | The current status of an approval branch (e.g. pending, approved, rejected) |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of debugging parallel approval branches include understanding the approval workflow, identifying potential synchronization points, and developing strategies to mitigate deadlocks and inconsistent approval states. This requires a deep understanding of the stakeholders involved, the approval process, and the potential failure points.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for debugging parallel approval branches involves the following steps:
1. Identify the approval workflow and the stakeholders involved
2. Determine the potential synchronization points and areas of contention
3. Develop strategies to mitigate deadlocks and inconsistent approval states
4. Implement logging and monitoring to track the approval process
5. Test and refine the approval workflow to ensure smooth execution

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in debugging parallel approval branches include:
* Using synchronization points to coordinate the execution of multiple approval branches
* Implementing timeout mechanisms to prevent deadlocks
* Using approval state tracking to monitor the status of each approval branch
* Developing custom logging and monitoring solutions to track the approval process

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in debugging parallel approval branches include:
* Ignoring potential synchronization points and areas of contention
* Failing to implement logging and monitoring to track the approval process
* Using overly complex approval workflows that are difficult to debug
* Neglecting to test and refine the approval workflow
