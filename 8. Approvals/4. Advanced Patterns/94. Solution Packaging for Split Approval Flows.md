# 94. Solution Packaging for Split Approval Flows

Canonical documentation for 94. Solution Packaging for Split Approval Flows. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 94. Solution Packaging for Split Approval Flows exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Solution Packaging for Split Approval Flows is to facilitate the efficient and secure deployment of solutions that require multiple approval stages. This approach addresses the challenges associated with traditional approval workflows, where a single approval stage can create bottlenecks and hinder the deployment process. By splitting the approval flow into multiple stages, organizations can streamline their deployment processes, reduce the risk of errors, and improve overall efficiency.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of Solution Packaging for Split Approval Flows involves the creation of a package that contains all the necessary components for a solution, including code, configurations, and metadata. This package is then split into multiple approval stages, each with its own set of approvers and validation criteria. The package is then deployed to each stage, where it is reviewed and approved before being promoted to the next stage.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Solution Package | A container that holds all the necessary components for a solution, including code, configurations, and metadata. |
| Approval Stage | A distinct phase in the approval flow where a package is reviewed and approved by a set of approvers. |
| Approver | An individual or group responsible for reviewing and approving a package at a particular approval stage. |
| Validation Criteria | A set of rules and conditions that a package must meet in order to be approved at a particular stage. |
| Deployment | The process of installing and configuring a solution package in a production environment. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Solution Packaging for Split Approval Flows include:
* **Modularity**: The ability to break down a solution into smaller, independent components that can be approved and deployed separately.
* **Flexibility**: The ability to customize the approval flow to meet the specific needs of an organization.
* **Security**: The ability to ensure that a solution is properly validated and approved before being deployed to production.
* **Efficiency**: The ability to streamline the deployment process and reduce the risk of errors.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Solution Packaging for Split Approval Flows involves the following stages:
1. **Development**: The solution is developed and packaged into a container.
2. **Testing**: The package is tested and validated to ensure it meets the required criteria.
3. **Approval**: The package is reviewed and approved by a set of approvers at each stage.
4. **Deployment**: The package is deployed to production.
5. **Monitoring**: The solution is monitored and maintained to ensure it continues to meet the required criteria.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Solution Packaging for Split Approval Flows include:
* **Sequential Approval**: Each approval stage is completed in sequence, with the package being promoted to the next stage only after approval.
* **Parallel Approval**: Multiple approval stages are completed concurrently, with the package being promoted to the next stage only after all approvals have been received.
* **Conditional Approval**: The approval flow is customized based on specific conditions, such as the type of solution or the environment it is being deployed to.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Solution Packaging for Split Approval Flows include:
* **Single-Stage Approval**: Using a single approval stage for all solutions, which can create bottlenecks and hinder the deployment process.
* **Manual Approval**: Using manual approval processes, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors.
* **Lack of Validation**: Failing to properly validate a solution before deploying it to production, which can lead to errors and security vulnerabilities.
