> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 99. When to Avoid Split Actions exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 99. When to Avoid Split Actions is to provide guidance on when to refrain from dividing a single, cohesive action into multiple, separate actions. This is crucial in various domains, including software development, business process management, and workflow optimization. The class of problems it addresses includes inefficiencies, complexities, and potential errors that may arise from splitting actions unnecessarily.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of 99. When to Avoid Split Actions involves understanding the trade-offs between splitting actions and keeping them intact. It requires considering factors such as action complexity, dependency, and frequency, as well as the potential benefits and drawbacks of splitting actions, including maintainability, scalability, and usability.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Action | A single, cohesive unit of work or activity |
| Split Action | The division of a single action into multiple, separate actions |
| Atomicity | The property of an action being indivisible and executed as a single, uninterruptible unit |
| Idempotence | The property of an action being executable multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 99. When to Avoid Split Actions include understanding the principles of action design, such as atomicity and idempotence. It also involves recognizing the importance of context, including the specific requirements and constraints of a given situation. Additionally, it requires considering the potential consequences of splitting actions, including increased complexity, decreased maintainability, and potential errors.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 99. When to Avoid Split Actions involves a decision-making process that considers the following factors:
1. Action complexity: Is the action simple or complex?
2. Dependency: Are there dependencies between the action and other actions or components?
3. Frequency: How frequently is the action executed?
4. Maintainability: Will splitting the action improve or decrease maintainability?
5. Scalability: Will splitting the action improve or decrease scalability?
6. Usability: Will splitting the action improve or decrease usability?

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for 99. When to Avoid Split Actions include:
1. **Single-Step Actions**: Keeping actions simple and atomic, avoiding unnecessary splits.
2. **Batch Processing**: Grouping multiple actions together to improve efficiency and reduce overhead.
3. **Transaction-Based Actions**: Ensuring that actions are executed as a single, uninterruptible unit to maintain data consistency and integrity.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for 99. When to Avoid Split Actions include:
1. **Over-Splitting**: Dividing actions into too many separate actions, leading to increased complexity and decreased maintainability.
2. **Under-Splitting**: Failing to split actions when necessary, leading to decreased scalability and usability.
3. **Splitting Without Context**: Splitting actions without considering the specific requirements and constraints of a given situation.
