> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 98. Resource Efficiency of Concurrent Logic exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 98. Resource Efficiency of Concurrent Logic is to optimize the utilization of system resources in concurrent systems, addressing the class of problems related to performance, scalability, and reliability. Concurrent logic refers to the ability of a system to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, which can lead to improved responsiveness, throughput, and system utilization. However, concurrent systems can also introduce challenges such as resource contention, deadlock, and starvation, which can negatively impact system performance and efficiency. The Resource Efficiency of Concurrent Logic exists to provide guidelines and best practices for designing and implementing concurrent systems that maximize resource utilization while minimizing waste and overhead.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of 98. Resource Efficiency of Concurrent Logic involves understanding the fundamental principles of concurrency, parallelism, and resource management. It encompasses the idea of breaking down complex tasks into smaller, independent units that can be executed concurrently, while ensuring efficient allocation and deallocation of system resources such as CPU, memory, and I/O devices. The mental model also includes the concept of synchronization, which refers to the coordination of access to shared resources to prevent conflicts and ensure data consistency.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Concurrency | The ability of a system to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, improving responsiveness and throughput. |
| Parallelism | The simultaneous execution of multiple tasks on multiple processing units, such as CPUs or cores. |
| Resource | A system component, such as CPU, memory, or I/O device, that is required to execute a task. |
| Synchronization | The coordination of access to shared resources to prevent conflicts and ensure data consistency. |
| Deadlock | A situation in which two or more tasks are blocked indefinitely, each waiting for the other to release a resource. |
| Starvation | A situation in which a task is unable to access a shared resource due to other tasks holding onto it for an extended period. |
