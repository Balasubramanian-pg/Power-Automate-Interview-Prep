Canonical documentation for 86. Parallel Branch Completion Requirements. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 86. Parallel Branch Completion Requirements exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Parallel Branch Completion Requirements exist to ensure that parallel branches in a workflow or business process are properly completed, synchronized, and managed. This addresses the class of problems related to inconsistent or incomplete parallel processing, which can lead to errors, delays, or deadlocks in the overall process.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Parallel Branch Completion Requirements can be conceptualized as a set of rules and constraints that govern the behavior of parallel branches in a workflow. This includes defining the conditions under which parallel branches are created, executed, and completed, as well as the mechanisms for synchronizing and merging the results of parallel branches.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Parallel Branch | A separate flow of execution that runs concurrently with other branches in a workflow |
| Completion Requirement | A condition or set of conditions that must be met for a parallel branch to be considered complete |
| Synchronization Point | A point in the workflow where parallel branches are synchronized or merged |
| Deadlock | A situation where two or more parallel branches are blocked, waiting for each other to complete |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Parallel Branch Completion Requirements include:
* Creating and managing parallel branches
* Defining completion requirements for parallel branches
* Synchronizing and merging parallel branches
* Handling errors and exceptions in parallel branches
* Avoiding deadlocks and other synchronization-related issues

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Parallel Branch Completion Requirements involves:
1. Identifying the parallel branches in a workflow
2. Defining the completion requirements for each parallel branch
3. Establishing synchronization points for merging parallel branches
4. Implementing error handling and exception mechanisms
5. Monitoring and managing the execution of parallel branches

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Parallel Branch Completion Requirements include:
* Using synchronization points to merge parallel branches
* Implementing completion requirements as conditional statements or decision tables
* Using error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions in parallel branches
* Utilizing monitoring and logging tools to track the execution of parallel branches

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Parallel Branch Completion Requirements include:
* Failing to define clear completion requirements for parallel branches
* Not establishing synchronization points for merging parallel branches
* Ignoring error handling and exception mechanisms
* Not monitoring or managing the execution of parallel branches
