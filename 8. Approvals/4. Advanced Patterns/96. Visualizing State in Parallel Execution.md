Canonical documentation for 96. Visualizing State in Parallel Execution. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 96. Visualizing State in Parallel Execution exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of visualizing state in parallel execution is to provide a clear and concise representation of the complex interactions and dependencies between concurrent processes or threads. This is essential in modern computing systems, where parallelism is increasingly used to improve performance, scalability, and responsiveness. The class of problems addressed by visualizing state in parallel execution includes debugging, performance optimization, and system design.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Visualizing state in parallel execution involves representing the dynamic behavior of concurrent systems, including the creation, execution, and synchronization of processes or threads. This can be achieved through various visualization techniques, such as graphs, charts, or animations, which help to illustrate the flow of execution, data dependencies, and communication between concurrent entities.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Parallel Execution | The simultaneous execution of multiple processes or threads to improve system performance and responsiveness. |
| Concurrency | The ability of a system to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, improving overall system utilization and throughput. |
| Visualization | The process of creating graphical representations of complex data or systems to facilitate understanding and analysis. |
| State | The current condition or status of a system, process, or thread, including its attributes, properties, and relationships. |
| Synchronization | The coordination of concurrent entities to ensure consistent and predictable behavior, often using mechanisms such as locks, semaphores, or monitors. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of visualizing state in parallel execution include:
* **Process/thread creation and execution**: The visualization of process or thread lifecycles, including creation, execution, and termination.
* **Synchronization and communication**: The representation of synchronization mechanisms, such as locks, semaphores, or monitors, and communication between concurrent entities.
* **Data dependencies and flow**: The illustration of data dependencies and flow between concurrent entities, including input, output, and shared data.
* **System state and behavior**: The visualization of system state and behavior, including performance metrics, errors, and exceptions.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for visualizing state in parallel execution involves a combination of graphical and textual representations, including:
* **Graphical timelines**: Visual representations of process or thread execution over time, including synchronization points and data dependencies.
* **System state diagrams**: Graphical representations of system state, including process or thread states, data dependencies, and synchronization mechanisms.
* **Performance metrics**: Textual or graphical representations of system performance, including metrics such as throughput, latency, and utilization.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in visualizing state in parallel execution include:
* **Master-slave patterns**: Visualizing a master process or thread that coordinates the execution of multiple slave processes or threads.
* **Pipeline patterns**: Visualizing a sequence of processes or threads that perform a series of tasks, with each stage depending on the output of the previous stage.
* **Client-server patterns**: Visualizing client processes or threads that request services from server processes or threads, with synchronization and communication between the client and server.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in visualizing state in parallel execution include:
* **Overly complex visualizations**: Visualizations that are too complex or detailed, making it difficult to understand the system behavior or performance.
* **Insufficient context**: Visualizations that lack sufficient context, making it difficult to understand the system state or behavior.
* **Inconsistent representations**: Inconsistent representations of system state or behavior, making it difficult to compare or analyze different visualizations.
