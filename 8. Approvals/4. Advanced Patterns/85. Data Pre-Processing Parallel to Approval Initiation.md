# 85. Data Pre-Processing Parallel to Approval Initiation

Canonical documentation for 85. Data Pre-Processing Parallel to Approval Initiation. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 85. Data Pre-Processing Parallel to Approval Initiation exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of Data Pre-Processing Parallel to Approval Initiation is to streamline the approval process by concurrently preparing data for review, thereby reducing the overall processing time and enhancing the efficiency of the system. This approach addresses the class of problems related to delayed approvals, data inconsistencies, and inefficient use of resources. By initiating data pre-processing in parallel with approval initiation, organizations can minimize the time spent on data preparation, reduce errors, and improve the overall quality of the approval process.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of Data Pre-Processing Parallel to Approval Initiation involves a parallel processing framework, where data pre-processing and approval initiation occur simultaneously. This framework consists of two primary components: a data pre-processing module and an approval initiation module. The data pre-processing module is responsible for preparing the data for review, which includes data cleaning, data transformation, and data validation. The approval initiation module is responsible for initiating the approval process, which includes assigning approvers, setting deadlines, and notifying stakeholders. By running these two modules in parallel, the system can reduce the overall processing time and improve the efficiency of the approval process.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Data Pre-Processing | The process of preparing data for review, including data cleaning, data transformation, and data validation. |
| Approval Initiation | The process of initiating the approval process, including assigning approvers, setting deadlines, and notifying stakeholders. |
| Parallel Processing | A processing framework where multiple tasks are executed simultaneously to improve efficiency and reduce processing time. |
| Data Quality | The measure of how well the data meets the requirements and expectations of the approval process. |
| Approval Workflow | A series of steps and tasks that are required to complete the approval process. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Data Pre-Processing Parallel to Approval Initiation include:
* Parallel processing: The ability to execute multiple tasks simultaneously to improve efficiency and reduce processing time.
* Data quality: The measure of how well the data meets the requirements and expectations of the approval process.
* Approval workflow: A series of steps and tasks that are required to complete the approval process.
* Data pre-processing: The process of preparing data for review, including data cleaning, data transformation, and data validation.
* Approval initiation: The process of initiating the approval process, including assigning approvers, setting deadlines, and notifying stakeholders.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Data Pre-Processing Parallel to Approval Initiation involves the following steps:
1. Receive approval request: The system receives an approval request, which triggers the initiation of the approval process.
2. Initiate approval process: The system initiates the approval process, including assigning approvers, setting deadlines, and notifying stakeholders.
3. Pre-process data: The system pre-processes the data in parallel with the approval initiation, including data cleaning, data transformation, and data validation.
4. Review and approve: The approvers review the pre-processed data and approve or reject the request.
5. Notify stakeholders: The system notifies stakeholders of the approval decision.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Data Pre-Processing Parallel to Approval Initiation include:
* Using automated workflows to streamline the approval process.
* Implementing data validation rules to ensure data quality.
* Using parallel processing to improve efficiency and reduce processing time.
* Providing real-time notifications to stakeholders.
* Using data analytics to monitor and improve the approval process.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Data Pre-Processing Parallel to Approval Initiation include:
* Serial processing: Processing data sequentially, which can lead to delays and inefficiencies.
* Manual data processing: Manually processing data, which can lead to errors and inconsistencies.
* Lack of data validation: Failing to validate data, which can lead to poor data quality and incorrect approval decisions.
* Inadequate notification: Failing to notify stakeholders of approval decisions, which can lead to delays and misunderstandings.
* Insufficient monitoring: Failing to monitor and analyze the approval process, which can lead to inefficiencies and poor decision-making.
