# 58. Anatomy of a Response Object

Canonical documentation for 58. Anatomy of a Response Object. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 58. Anatomy of a Response Object exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Anatomy of a Response Object exists to provide a standardized framework for constructing and interpreting responses in various computing contexts, such as web development, API design, and network communication. It addresses the class of problems related to inconsistent, incomplete, or poorly structured responses, which can lead to errors, misunderstandings, and difficulties in debugging and maintenance.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
A Response Object is a data structure that encapsulates the outcome of a request, operation, or interaction. It typically consists of a combination of metadata, payload, and error information, which are organized in a hierarchical or flat structure. The Response Object serves as a container for conveying information about the result of an action, allowing the recipient to understand the outcome, extract relevant data, and take appropriate actions.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Response Object | A data structure that encapsulates the outcome of a request, operation, or interaction. |
| Payload | The primary data or content being conveyed in the Response Object. |
| Metadata | Additional information about the Response Object, such as headers, status codes, or timestamps. |
| Error Information | Data related to errors or exceptions that occurred during the processing of the request or operation. |
| Status Code | A numerical or textual code indicating the outcome of the request or operation. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Anatomy of a Response Object include:
* **Modularity**: The Response Object should be designed as a self-contained unit, allowing for easy composition and decomposition.
* **Standardization**: The structure and content of the Response Object should adhere to established conventions and protocols.
* **Flexibility**: The Response Object should be able to accommodate varying types and amounts of data, as well as different error scenarios.
* **Readability**: The Response Object should be easy to understand and parse, both for humans and machines.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for a Response Object typically includes the following components:
* **HTTP Status Code**: A numerical code indicating the outcome of the request (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).
* **HTTP Headers**: Metadata about the Response Object, such as content type, caching instructions, or authentication tokens.
* **Payload**: The primary data or content being conveyed in the Response Object, such as JSON data, XML documents, or binary files.
* **Error Information**: Data related to errors or exceptions that occurred during the processing of the request or operation, such as error messages, stack traces, or debugging information.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Response Objects include:
* **JSON API**: Using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) as the primary data format for the payload and metadata.
* **Error Wrapping**: Encapsulating error information in a standardized wrapper, such as a JSON object with error codes and messages.
* **Pagination**: Including metadata about pagination, such as page numbers, offsets, and limits, to facilitate navigation and retrieval of large datasets.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Response Objects include:
* **Inconsistent Structure**: Using different structures or formats for similar Response Objects, making it difficult for clients to parse and understand the data.
* **Insufficient Error Information**: Failing to provide adequate error information, making it challenging for clients to diagnose and handle errors.
* **Overly Complex Payloads**: Including excessive or unnecessary data in the payload, leading to increased latency, bandwidth usage, and processing overhead.
