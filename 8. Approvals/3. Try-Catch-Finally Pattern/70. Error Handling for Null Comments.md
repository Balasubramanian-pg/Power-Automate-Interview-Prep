Canonical documentation for 70. Error Handling for Null Comments. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 70. Error Handling for Null Comments exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of error handling for null comments is to prevent application crashes, data corruption, or unexpected behavior when encountering null or empty comments in various systems, such as databases, file systems, or online platforms. The problem space includes scenarios where null comments can cause errors, inconsistencies, or security vulnerabilities, ultimately affecting the reliability, performance, and user experience of the system.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Error handling for null comments involves a set of mechanisms, policies, and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and respond to null comment-related errors. This includes input validation, comment filtering, error detection, and exception handling, ensuring that the system can gracefully handle null comments and maintain its integrity.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Null Comment | A comment that is empty, null, or contains only whitespace characters. |
| Comment Validation | The process of checking comments for validity, including checks for null or empty comments. |
| Error Handling | The process of detecting, preventing, and responding to errors, including those caused by null comments. |
| Exception Handling | A mechanism for handling exceptional events, such as errors caused by null comments, to prevent application crashes or data corruption. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of error handling for null comments include:
* Input validation: checking comments for validity before processing them.
* Comment filtering: removing or replacing null comments to prevent errors.
* Error detection: identifying errors caused by null comments.
* Exception handling: responding to errors caused by null comments to maintain system integrity.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for error handling for null comments involves a multi-step approach:
1. Input validation: validate comments before processing them.
2. Comment filtering: remove or replace null comments.
3. Error detection: detect errors caused by null comments.
4. Exception handling: respond to errors caused by null comments.
5. Logging and monitoring: log and monitor errors to improve the system's reliability and performance.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for error handling for null comments include:
* Using default values for null comments.
* Ignoring null comments.
* Replacing null comments with a default comment.
* Logging null comment errors for further analysis.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for error handling for null comments include:
* Ignoring null comment errors, which can lead to data corruption or security vulnerabilities.
* Using null comments as a default value, which can cause errors or inconsistencies.
* Not validating comments, which can lead to errors or security vulnerabilities.
