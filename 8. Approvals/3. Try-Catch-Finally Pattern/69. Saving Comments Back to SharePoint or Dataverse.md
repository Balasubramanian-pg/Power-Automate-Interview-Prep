Canonical documentation for 69. Saving Comments Back to SharePoint or Dataverse. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 69. Saving Comments Back to SharePoint or Dataverse exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of saving comments back to SharePoint or Dataverse is to ensure that all relevant feedback, discussions, and insights related to a particular item, document, or record are properly captured and stored in a centralized location. This addresses the problem of information fragmentation, where valuable comments and discussions are scattered across different platforms, tools, or email threads, making it difficult to track, manage, and leverage them effectively.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of saving comments back to SharePoint or Dataverse involves a feedback loop where users can provide comments on a particular item, and these comments are then saved back to the source system, either SharePoint or Dataverse. This creates a single source of truth for all comments and discussions, enabling better collaboration, decision-making, and knowledge management.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| SharePoint | A web-based collaborative platform that integrates with Microsoft Office, providing a centralized location for storing, organizing, and sharing documents and information. |
| Dataverse | A cloud-based data platform that provides a centralized location for storing, managing, and integrating data from various sources, enabling better data-driven decision-making. |
| Comment | A user-provided feedback or discussion item related to a particular document, record, or item. |
| Item | A document, record, or entity that is being commented on or discussed. |
| Source System | The system where the item is originally stored, such as SharePoint or Dataverse. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of saving comments back to SharePoint or Dataverse include:
* **Centralized commenting**: The ability to capture and store comments in a single, centralized location.
* **Integration**: The ability to integrate commenting functionality with the source system, either SharePoint or Dataverse.
* **Data consistency**: The ability to ensure that comments are accurately reflected in the source system, without duplication or data loss.
* **Security and permissions**: The ability to control access to comments and ensure that only authorized users can view, edit, or delete them.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for saving comments back to SharePoint or Dataverse involves the following steps:
1. **Comment submission**: A user submits a comment on a particular item.
2. **Comment processing**: The comment is processed and validated to ensure it meets the required criteria.
3. **Comment storage**: The comment is stored in the source system, either SharePoint or Dataverse.
4. **Comment synchronization**: The comment is synchronized with the source system to ensure data consistency.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for saving comments back to SharePoint or Dataverse include:
* **Using APIs**: Using application programming interfaces (APIs) to integrate commenting functionality with the source system.
* **Using webhooks**: Using webhooks to notify the source system of new or updated comments.
* **Using workflows**: Using workflows to automate the comment submission and processing process.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for saving comments back to SharePoint or Dataverse include:
* **Data duplication**: Storing comments in multiple locations, leading to data duplication and inconsistency.
* **Lack of integration**: Failing to integrate commenting functionality with the source system, leading to fragmented data and poor user experience.
* **Inadequate security**: Failing to implement proper security and permissions, leading to unauthorized access to comments.
