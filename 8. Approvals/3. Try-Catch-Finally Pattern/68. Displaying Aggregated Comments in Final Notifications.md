> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 68. Displaying Aggregated Comments in Final Notifications exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of displaying aggregated comments in final notifications is to provide a concise and informative summary of feedback, opinions, or discussions related to a particular topic, decision, or action. This feature addresses the problem of information overload, where individuals may struggle to sift through numerous comments, emails, or messages to understand the overall sentiment or key points. By aggregating comments, final notifications can facilitate better decision-making, improve communication, and enhance collaboration.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of displaying aggregated comments in final notifications involves collecting and processing comments from various sources, such as discussion forums, email threads, or feedback forms. These comments are then analyzed, categorized, and summarized to extract key themes, sentiments, or insights. The aggregated comments are subsequently presented in a concise and easily digestible format, often using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, machine learning algorithms, or data visualization methods.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
