# 74. Limitations of the Outcome Property in Wait for All

Canonical documentation for 74. Limitations of the Outcome Property in Wait for All. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 74. Limitations of the Outcome Property in Wait for All exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Outcome Property in Wait for All is a crucial component in workflow management and parallel processing systems. However, it has several limitations that can lead to inefficiencies, deadlocks, and incorrect results. The primary purpose of this documentation is to outline these limitations and provide guidance on how to mitigate them. The class of problems addressed includes workflow management, parallel processing, and concurrent programming.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Outcome Property in Wait for All is a mechanism that allows a workflow or process to wait for the completion of multiple tasks or threads. The outcome of each task is then used to determine the overall outcome of the workflow. However, this property has limitations, such as the inability to handle asynchronous tasks, lack of support for fault-tolerant workflows, and limited scalability.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Outcome Property | A mechanism that determines the overall outcome of a workflow based on the outcomes of individual tasks. |
| Wait for All | A synchronization mechanism that allows a workflow or process to wait for the completion of multiple tasks or threads. |
| Asynchronous Task | A task that runs independently of the main workflow or process. |
| Fault-Tolerant Workflow | A workflow that can continue executing even if one or more tasks fail. |
| Scalability | The ability of a system to handle increased workload or traffic without compromising performance. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Outcome Property in Wait for All include:
* Synchronization: The mechanism of waiting for multiple tasks to complete before proceeding with the workflow.
* Outcome Determination: The process of determining the overall outcome of the workflow based on the outcomes of individual tasks.
* Asynchronous Task Handling: The ability to handle tasks that run independently of the main workflow or process.
* Fault-Tolerant Workflow Design: The design of workflows that can continue executing even if one or more tasks fail.
* Scalability Considerations: The ability of the system to handle increased workload or traffic without compromising performance.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the Outcome Property in Wait for All involves the following components:
* A workflow or process that waits for the completion of multiple tasks or threads.
* A mechanism for determining the outcome of each task.
* A mechanism for determining the overall outcome of the workflow based on the outcomes of individual tasks.
* Support for asynchronous task handling and fault-tolerant workflow design.
* Considerations for scalability and performance.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for the Outcome Property in Wait for All include:
* Using a centralized workflow manager to coordinate the execution of tasks and determine the overall outcome.
* Implementing asynchronous task handling using callbacks or futures.
* Designing fault-tolerant workflows using retry mechanisms or redundant tasks.
* Optimizing scalability and performance using load balancing, caching, or parallel processing.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for the Outcome Property in Wait for All include:
* Using a sequential approach to wait for each task to complete, resulting in inefficient workflow execution.
* Ignoring asynchronous task handling, leading to deadlocks or incorrect results.
* Failing to design fault-tolerant workflows, resulting in workflow failures or errors.
* Neglecting scalability and performance considerations, leading to system overload or degradation.
