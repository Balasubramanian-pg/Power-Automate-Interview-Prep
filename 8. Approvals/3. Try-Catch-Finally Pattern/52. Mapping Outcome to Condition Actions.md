> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 52. Mapping Outcome to Condition Actions exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of mapping outcome to condition actions is to establish a clear and systematic approach to handling various outcomes that arise from specific conditions. This approach addresses the problem of inconsistent and inefficient handling of outcomes, which can lead to errors, delays, and decreased productivity. By mapping outcomes to condition actions, individuals and organizations can ensure that they are well-prepared to respond to different scenarios, mitigate risks, and capitalize on opportunities.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of mapping outcome to condition actions involves understanding the relationships between conditions, outcomes, and actions. It requires identifying the potential conditions that may arise, determining the possible outcomes for each condition, and specifying the appropriate actions to take in response to each outcome. This mental model involves a systematic and structured approach to decision-making, where the focus is on anticipating and preparing for different scenarios, rather than reacting to them after they occur.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Condition | A specific situation or circumstance that may arise, such as an error, exception, or opportunity. |
| Outcome | The result or consequence of a condition, such as a success, failure, or neutral result. |
| Action | A specific response or set of responses to an outcome, such as a correction, notification, or escalation. |
| Mapping | The process of associating outcomes with condition actions, to ensure a consistent and systematic approach to handling different scenarios. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of mapping outcome to condition actions include:
* **Condition identification**: The process of identifying potential conditions that may arise, and determining their characteristics and implications.
* **Outcome determination**: The process of determining the possible outcomes for each condition, and evaluating their likelihood and impact.
* **Action specification**: The process of specifying the appropriate actions to take in response to each outcome, and ensuring that they are consistent and effective.
* **Mapping**: The process of associating outcomes with condition actions, to ensure a consistent and systematic approach to handling different scenarios.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for mapping outcome to condition actions involves the following steps:
1. Identify potential conditions and determine their characteristics and implications.
2. Determine the possible outcomes for each condition, and evaluate their likelihood and impact.
3. Specify the appropriate actions to take in response to each outcome, and ensure that they are consistent and effective.
4. Map the outcomes to the condition actions, using a systematic and structured approach.
5. Review and refine the mapping, to ensure that it is accurate, complete, and effective.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for mapping outcome to condition actions include:
* **Error handling**: Mapping error outcomes to corrective actions, such as error correction, notification, or escalation.
* **Exception handling**: Mapping exception outcomes to alternative actions, such as exception handling, notification, or escalation.
* **Opportunity handling**: Mapping opportunity outcomes to proactive actions, such as opportunity exploitation, notification, or escalation.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for mapping outcome to condition actions include:
* **Inconsistent mapping**: Failing to establish a consistent and systematic approach to mapping outcomes to condition actions.
* **Incomplete mapping**: Failing to identify and map all possible outcomes for each condition.
* **Ineffective mapping**: Failing to specify effective actions in response to each outcome, or failing to ensure that the mapping is accurate and complete.
