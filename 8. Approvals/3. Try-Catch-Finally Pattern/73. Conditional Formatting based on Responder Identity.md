Canonical documentation for 73. Conditional Formatting based on Responder Identity. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 73. Conditional Formatting based on Responder Identity exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Conditional Formatting based on Responder Identity exists to enable dynamic visualization and differentiation of data based on the identity of responders, such as users, teams, or organizations, in various applications, including surveys, feedback systems, and data analytics platforms. The primary problem it addresses is the need to highlight, categorize, or prioritize data based on the characteristics, roles, or attributes of the responders, thereby facilitating more informed decision-making, improved user experience, and enhanced data insights.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of Conditional Formatting based on Responder Identity involves a rules-based system that applies visual formatting, such as colors, icons, or fonts, to data elements, like text, numbers, or images, in response to specific conditions related to the responder's identity. These conditions can include responder attributes, such as name, role, department, location, or other relevant characteristics. The system evaluates the responder's identity against predefined rules and applies the corresponding formatting to provide a visual representation of the data, making it easier to understand, analyze, and act upon.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Responder | An individual or entity that provides input, feedback, or data, such as a user, customer, or team member. |
| Responder Identity | The characteristics, attributes, or properties that define a responder, including name, role, department, location, and other relevant information. |
| Conditional Formatting | A rules-based system that applies visual formatting to data elements based on specific conditions or criteria. |
| Formatting Rules | Predefined conditions or criteria that determine when to apply specific visual formatting to data elements. |
| Data Element | A unit of data, such as text, numbers, or images, that can be formatted using conditional formatting. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Conditional Formatting based on Responder Identity include:
* **Responder profiling**: The process of collecting and storing information about responders, including their attributes and characteristics.
* **Rule-based formatting**: The application of visual formatting to data elements based on predefined rules and conditions.
* **Dynamic visualization**: The ability to update and change the visual representation of data in real-time based on changes to the responder's identity or other conditions.
* **Data differentiation**: The ability to distinguish and categorize data based on the responder's identity, facilitating more informed decision-making and analysis.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Conditional Formatting based on Responder Identity involves the following components:
* **Responder database**: A repository that stores information about responders, including their attributes and characteristics.
* **Formatting rules engine**: A system that evaluates the responder's identity against predefined rules and applies the corresponding formatting.
* **Data visualization layer**: A component that applies the visual formatting to the data elements, providing a dynamic and interactive representation of the data.
* **User interface**: A layer that allows users to interact with the system, define formatting rules, and view the formatted data.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Conditional Formatting based on Responder Identity include:
* **Highlighting important responders**: Applying distinct formatting to data elements associated with high-priority or critical responders.
* **Categorizing responders**: Using formatting to group responders by attributes, such as role, department, or location.
* **Visualizing responder trends**: Applying formatting to illustrate trends or patterns in responder data, such as changes in sentiment or behavior.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Conditional Formatting based on Responder Identity include:
* **Over-formatting**: Applying too many formatting rules, leading to visual clutter and decreased usability.
* **Inconsistent formatting**: Using inconsistent or contradictory formatting rules, causing confusion and decreasing the effectiveness of the system.
* **Ignoring responder context**: Failing to consider the responder's context, such as their role or location, when applying formatting rules.
