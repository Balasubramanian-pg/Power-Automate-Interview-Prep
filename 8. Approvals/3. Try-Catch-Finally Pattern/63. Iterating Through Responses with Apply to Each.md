> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 63. Iterating Through Responses with Apply to Each exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 63. Iterating Through Responses with Apply to Each is to provide a standardized approach to handling and processing multiple responses or data sets in a workflow or business process. This functionality addresses the class of problems related to automating repetitive tasks, improving data consistency, and enhancing overall process efficiency. By utilizing Apply to Each, users can iterate through responses, perform actions, and make decisions based on the data, thereby streamlining their workflows.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of 63. Iterating Through Responses with Apply to Each involves a loop-based structure that enables the iteration over a collection of data or responses. This structure typically includes a trigger or initiation point, a loop or iteration mechanism, and an action or set of actions to be performed on each item in the collection. The Apply to Each functionality serves as the core component, allowing users to define the actions and decisions to be made during each iteration.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Apply to Each | A functionality that enables the iteration over a collection of data or responses, allowing users to perform actions and make decisions on each item. |
| Iteration | The process of repeating a set of actions or instructions for each item in a collection. |
| Collection | A set of data or responses that can be iterated over using the Apply to Each functionality. |
| Loop | A control structure that enables the repetition of a set of actions or instructions. |
| Action | A specific task or set of tasks performed on each item in the collection during iteration. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 63. Iterating Through Responses with Apply to Each include:
* **Iteration**: The ability to repeat a set of actions or instructions for each item in a collection.
* **Collection**: A set of data or responses that can be iterated over.
* **Actions**: Specific tasks or sets of tasks performed on each item in the collection during iteration.
* **Decisions**: The ability to make choices or take different paths based on the data or responses being iterated over.
* **Loop Control**: The ability to manage and control the iteration process, including starting, stopping, and skipping items.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 63. Iterating Through Responses with Apply to Each typically involves the following components:
1. **Trigger**: An event or action that initiates the iteration process.
2. **Collection**: A set of data or responses that is iterated over.
3. **Apply to Each**: The functionality that enables the iteration over the collection.
4. **Actions**: Specific tasks or sets of tasks performed on each item in the collection during iteration.
5. **Decisions**: The ability to make choices or take different paths based on the data or responses being iterated over.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for 63. Iterating Through Responses with Apply to Each include:
* **Data Processing**: Iterating over a collection of data to perform tasks such as data validation, data transformation, or data aggregation.
* **Workflow Automation**: Using Apply to Each to automate repetitive tasks or business processes.
* **Decision-Making**: Iterating over a collection of data to make decisions or take different paths based on the data or responses.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for 63. Iterating Through Responses with Apply to Each include:
* **Inefficient Looping**: Using unnecessary or inefficient looping structures that can lead to performance issues or errors.
* **Tight Coupling**: Overly coupling the iteration process to specific data or responses, making it difficult to modify or maintain.
* **Lack of Error Handling**: Failing to implement proper error handling mechanisms, leading to errors or exceptions during iteration.
