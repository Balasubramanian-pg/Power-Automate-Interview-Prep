## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 55. Using Switch Actions for Multi-Choice Outcomes exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of using switch actions for multi-choice outcomes is to provide a flexible and efficient way to handle multiple possible outcomes in a workflow or business process. This approach addresses the problem of complexity and rigidity in traditional decision-making models, where a single choice or outcome is predetermined. By using switch actions, developers and designers can create more dynamic and responsive systems that can adapt to changing circumstances and user needs.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of using switch actions for multi-choice outcomes involves a decision-making process that evaluates a set of conditions or inputs and selects one or more possible outcomes based on those conditions. This process can be represented as a flowchart or state machine, where each state or node represents a possible outcome, and the transitions between states are determined by the switch actions. The switch actions themselves can be thought of as a set of rules or mappings that define the relationships between the inputs, conditions, and outcomes.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Switch Action | A rule or mapping that defines the relationship between a set of inputs or conditions and a possible outcome. |
| Multi-Choice Outcome | A decision-making process that results in one or more possible outcomes, each with its own set of consequences or actions. |
| Condition | A statement or expression that evaluates to true or false, used to determine the outcome of a switch action. |
| Input | A piece of data or information used to evaluate a condition or determine the outcome of a switch action. |
| Outcome | A possible result or consequence of a switch action, which can be a single state or a set of states. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of using switch actions for multi-choice outcomes include:
* **Decision-making**: The process of evaluating a set of conditions or inputs to determine a possible outcome.
* **Condition evaluation**: The process of evaluating a condition or statement to determine its truth value.
* **Outcome selection**: The process of selecting one or more possible outcomes based on the results of the condition evaluation.
* **Switch action**: A rule or mapping that defines the relationship between a set of inputs or conditions and a possible outcome.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for using switch actions for multi-choice outcomes involves the following components:
* **Decision table**: A table or matrix that defines the relationships between the inputs, conditions, and outcomes.
* **Condition evaluator**: A component that evaluates the conditions and determines the truth values.
* **Outcome selector**: A component that selects one or more possible outcomes based on the results of the condition evaluation.
* **Action executor**: A component that executes the actions associated with the selected outcome.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for using switch actions for multi-choice outcomes include:
* **Simple decision-making**: A single condition or input determines a single outcome.
* **Complex decision-making**: Multiple conditions or inputs determine multiple possible outcomes.
* **Hierarchical decision-making**: A set of conditions or inputs determines a set of outcomes, which are then evaluated to determine a final outcome.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for using switch actions for multi-choice outcomes include:
* **Overly complex decision tables**: Decision tables that are too large or complex, making it difficult to maintain or understand the relationships between the inputs, conditions, and outcomes.
* **Tight coupling**: Components that are tightly coupled, making it difficult to change or replace one component without affecting others.
* **Magic numbers**: Using hardcoded values or "magic numbers" instead of named constants or variables.
