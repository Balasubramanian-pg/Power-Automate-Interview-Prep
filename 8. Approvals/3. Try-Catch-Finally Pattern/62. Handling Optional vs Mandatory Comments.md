# 62. Handling Optional vs Mandatory Comments

Canonical documentation for 62. Handling Optional vs Mandatory Comments. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 62. Handling Optional vs Mandatory Comments exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of handling optional vs mandatory comments is to provide a clear understanding of the differences between comments that are required for the functionality or understanding of a system, and those that are supplementary or provide additional context. This distinction is crucial in software development, technical writing, and documentation to ensure clarity, completeness, and usability of the information being conveyed. The class of problems it addresses includes ambiguity in documentation, misunderstandings due to incomplete information, and the necessity to prioritize essential comments over supplementary ones.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Handling optional vs mandatory comments involves understanding the role of comments in various contexts, such as code, documents, and user interfaces. It requires distinguishing between comments that are essential for the operation, understanding, or compliance of a system (mandatory comments) and those that provide additional information, insights, or context but are not critical for the primary function (optional comments). This conceptual model is foundational in ensuring that communication is effective, efficient, and tailored to the needs of the audience.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Mandatory Comment | A comment that is required for the proper understanding, operation, or compliance of a system, without which the system may not function as intended or may lead to misunderstandings. |
| Optional Comment | A comment that provides supplementary information, context, or insights but is not essential for the primary function or understanding of a system. |
| Comment Density | The ratio of comments to the overall content, which can affect readability and usability. |
| Contextual Comment | A comment that is relevant and provides value within a specific context or section of the content. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts in handling optional vs mandatory comments include:
- **Necessity**: Understanding what comments are necessary for the system's functionality or audience's understanding.
- **Relevance**: Ensuring that comments, whether optional or mandatory, are relevant to their context.
- **Clarity**: Comments should be clear and concise to avoid confusion.
- **Prioritization**: Prioritizing mandatory comments over optional ones to ensure essential information is conveyed.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for handling optional vs mandatory comments involves:
1. **Identification**: Clearly identifying which comments are mandatory and which are optional.
2. **Prioritization**: Ensuring that mandatory comments are given precedence in terms of placement, visibility, and emphasis.
3. **Review**: Regularly reviewing comments to ensure they remain relevant and accurate.
4. **Maintenance**: Updating comments as necessary to reflect changes in the system or understanding.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns include:
- Using clear and concise language in mandatory comments.
- Placing optional comments in secondary or expandable sections to avoid clutter.
- Utilizing visual cues (e.g., icons, colors) to differentiate between mandatory and optional comments.
- Implementing a commenting system that allows for easy identification and management of comment types.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns include:
- **Over-commenting**: Providing too many optional comments that obscure mandatory information.
- **Under-commenting**: Failing to include necessary mandatory comments.
- **Inconsistent Commenting**: Inconsistently applying the distinction between mandatory and optional comments, leading to confusion.
- **Outdated Comments**: Failing to update comments to reflect changes, making them misleading or irrelevant.
