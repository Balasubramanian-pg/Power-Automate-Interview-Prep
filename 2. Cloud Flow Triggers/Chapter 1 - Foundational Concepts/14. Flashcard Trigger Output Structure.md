# 14. Flashcard Trigger Output Structure

Canonical documentation for 14. Flashcard Trigger Output Structure. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The Flashcard Trigger Output Structure exists to provide a standardized framework for designing and implementing flashcard-based learning systems. The class of problems it addresses includes the need for a structured approach to creating, organizing, and presenting flashcards in a way that maximizes learning efficiency and effectiveness. The risks or failures that arise when this topic is misunderstood or inconsistently applied include poorly designed flashcard systems that lead to user frustration, decreased engagement, and reduced learning outcomes.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The Flashcard Trigger Output Structure conceptual model consists of three major components: 
1. **Flashcard Content**: The actual content presented on the flashcard, including the question or prompt and the answer or response.
2. **Trigger Mechanism**: The mechanism that determines when a flashcard is presented to the user, such as a schedule or a user's interaction with the system.
3. **Output Structure**: The format and organization of the flashcard content and trigger mechanism, including the user interface and any additional features or functionality.

These components relate to one another in that the flashcard content is presented to the user through the output structure, which is triggered by the trigger mechanism. The outcome of this model is to produce an effective and engaging learning experience for the user.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

The scope of this documentation includes:
* **Flashcard Design Principles**: The fundamental principles and guidelines for designing effective flashcards.
* **Trigger Mechanism Implementation**: The implementation details of the trigger mechanism, including scheduling and user interaction.

Out of scope are:
* Tool-specific implementations: The specific implementation details of flashcard systems using particular tools or technologies.
* Vendor-specific behavior: The behavior of flashcard systems provided by specific vendors or companies.
* Operational or procedural guidance: The operational or procedural aspects of using flashcard systems, such as training or support.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Flashcard | A card or digital equivalent that presents a question or prompt on one side and the answer or response on the other. |
| Trigger Mechanism | The mechanism that determines when a flashcard is presented to the user. |
| Output Structure | The format and organization of the flashcard content and trigger mechanism. |
| Spaced Repetition | A learning technique that involves reviewing material at increasingly longer intervals to help solidify it in long-term memory. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Flashcard Content
The flashcard content is the actual information presented on the flashcard, including the question or prompt and the answer or response. This content should be designed to be clear, concise, and relevant to the learning objective.

### 5.2 Trigger Mechanism
The trigger mechanism determines when a flashcard is presented to the user. This can be based on a schedule, user interaction, or other factors. The trigger mechanism should be designed to optimize the learning experience, such as by using spaced repetition.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The flashcard content, trigger mechanism, and output structure interact in that the flashcard content is presented to the user through the output structure, which is triggered by the trigger mechanism. Constraints include the need for clear and concise content, an effective trigger mechanism, and a well-designed output structure.

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for the Flashcard Trigger Output Structure consists of a flashcard content component, a trigger mechanism component, and an output structure component. The flashcard content component presents the question or prompt and the answer or response. The trigger mechanism component determines when the flashcard is presented to the user. The output structure component formats and organizes the flashcard content and trigger mechanism.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that the flashcard content is well-designed and relevant to the learning objective, the trigger mechanism is effective and optimized for the learning experience, and the output structure is clear and easy to use.

### 6.3 Invariants
The invariants of the standard model include the need for clear and concise flashcard content, an effective trigger mechanism, and a well-designed output structure.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern A: Spaced Repetition
- **Intent:** To help solidify information in long-term memory by reviewing it at increasingly longer intervals.
- **Context:** When the learning objective involves memorization or recall of information.
- **Tradeoffs:** The tradeoff is between the frequency of review and the retention of information. More frequent review can lead to better retention, but may also lead to user fatigue.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern A: Overly Complex Flashcard Content
- **Description:** Flashcard content that is overly complex or difficult to understand.
- **Failure Mode:** Users may become frustrated or disengaged due to the complexity of the content.
- **Common Causes:** Poor design or a lack of understanding of the learning objective.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Edge cases include situations where the flashcard content is ambiguous or open-ended, or where the trigger mechanism is not optimized for the learning experience. Boundary conditions include the limits of the flashcard content, such as the maximum length of the question or answer, and the limits of the trigger mechanism, such as the minimum or maximum interval between reviews.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.
