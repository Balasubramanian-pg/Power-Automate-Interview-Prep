# 12. Flashcard Role of a Trigger

Canonical documentation for 12. Flashcard Role of a Trigger. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The Flashcard Role of a Trigger exists to facilitate efficient and effective learning through the strategic use of triggers in flashcard-based educational systems. The class of problems it addresses includes the optimization of knowledge retention, the reduction of study time, and the improvement of overall learning outcomes. Misunderstanding or inconsistent application of this concept can lead to decreased learning efficiency, increased study time, and reduced knowledge retention. The risks or failures that arise from this include poor academic performance, decreased learner engagement, and inefficient use of educational resources.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The high-level mental model of the Flashcard Role of a Trigger consists of three major conceptual components: the trigger, the flashcard, and the learning outcome. The trigger is a cue or stimulus that prompts the recall of information from memory. The flashcard is a tool used to present the trigger and the associated information. The learning outcome is the desired result of the learning process, such as the retention of knowledge or the development of a skill. These components relate to one another in that the trigger is used to activate the recall of information from memory, which is then reinforced through the use of the flashcard, ultimately leading to the achievement of the learning outcome.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

The explicit boundaries of this documentation are as follows:

**In scope:**
* The conceptual model of the Flashcard Role of a Trigger
* The terminology and definitions related to this concept

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

The following terms are defined for use throughout this document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Trigger | A cue or stimulus that prompts the recall of information from memory |
| Flashcard | A tool used to present a trigger and the associated information |
| Learning Outcome | The desired result of the learning process, such as the retention of knowledge or the development of a skill |
| Spaced Repetition | A learning technique that involves reviewing material at increasingly longer intervals to improve retention |
| Active Recall | The process of actively recalling information from memory, rather than simply re-reading it |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

The fundamental ideas that form the basis of the Flashcard Role of a Trigger are:

### 5.1 Trigger
The trigger is a critical component of the Flashcard Role of a Trigger, as it provides the cue or stimulus that prompts the recall of information from memory. The trigger should be designed to be memorable and easy to associate with the relevant information.

### 5.2 Flashcard
The flashcard is a tool used to present the trigger and the associated information. The flashcard should be designed to be concise, clear, and easy to use, with a clear separation between the trigger and the relevant information.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The trigger and flashcard interact in that the trigger is used to activate the recall of information from memory, which is then reinforced through the use of the flashcard. The constraint is that the trigger must be designed to be memorable and easy to associate with the relevant information, and the flashcard must be designed to be concise, clear, and easy to use.

## 6. Standard Model

The generally accepted or recommended model for the Flashcard Role of a Trigger is as follows:

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model involves the use of a trigger to activate the recall of information from memory, which is then reinforced through the use of a flashcard. The flashcard presents the trigger and the associated information, and the learner is prompted to recall the information from memory.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The assumptions under which this model is valid include:

* The learner has prior knowledge of the subject matter
* The trigger is designed to be memorable and easy to associate with the relevant information
* The flashcard is designed to be concise, clear, and easy to use

### 6.3 Invariants
The properties that must always hold true within this model include:

* The trigger must be used to activate the recall of information from memory
* The flashcard must present the trigger and the associated information
* The learner must be prompted to recall the information from memory

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

The following recurring, accepted patterns are associated with the Flashcard Role of a Trigger:

### Pattern A: Spaced Repetition
- **Intent:** To improve retention of information through the use of spaced repetition
- **Context:** When the learner needs to retain information over a long period of time
- **Tradeoffs:** The learner must review the material at increasingly longer intervals, which can be time-consuming and require discipline

## 8. Anti-Patterns

The following common but discouraged practices are associated with the Flashcard Role of a Trigger:

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern A: Passive Reading
- **Description:** The learner simply re-reads the material without actively recalling it from memory
- **Failure Mode:** The learner fails to retain the information and does not develop a deep understanding of the subject matter
- **Common Causes:** The learner is not motivated to engage with the material, or the material is not presented in a way that encourages active recall

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

The following unusual or ambiguous scenarios may challenge the standard model:

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.

* The learner has no prior knowledge of the subject matter
* The trigger is not designed to be memorable or easy to associate with the relevant information
* The flashcard is not designed to be concise, clear, and easy to use
