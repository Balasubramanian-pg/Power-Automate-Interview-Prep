# 11. Viewing Trigger Outputs in Run History

Canonical documentation for 11. Viewing Trigger Outputs in Run History. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The topic of viewing trigger outputs in run history exists to address the need for transparency and accountability in automated workflows. It provides a means to track, analyze, and understand the outcomes of trigger events, which is crucial for debugging, optimization, and compliance. The class of problems it addresses includes identifying errors, understanding workflow behavior, and ensuring regulatory adherence. Misunderstanding or inconsistent application of this topic can lead to undetected errors, inefficient workflows, and non-compliance, resulting in financial losses, reputational damage, and legal issues.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of viewing trigger outputs in run history consists of three major components: triggers, runs, and outputs. Triggers are events that initiate workflows, runs represent the execution of these workflows, and outputs are the results or artifacts produced by these runs. These components relate to one another in that triggers initiate runs, and runs produce outputs. The model is designed to produce a clear, tamper-evident record of workflow execution, enabling users to understand what happened, when, and why.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

The scope of this documentation includes:

**In scope:**
* Conceptual models for trigger outputs in run history
* Terminology and definitions related to viewing trigger outputs
* Core concepts and interactions between triggers, runs, and outputs

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations for viewing trigger outputs
* Vendor-specific behavior or customizations
* Operational or procedural guidance for workflow management

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Trigger | An event that initiates a workflow or automated process. |
| Run | The execution of a workflow or automated process initiated by a trigger. |
| Output | The result or artifact produced by a run, which can include logs, files, or other data. |
| Run History | A record of all runs executed by a workflow or automated process, including their triggers, outputs, and other relevant details. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Triggers
Triggers are the starting point for runs and can be based on various events, such as time schedules, data changes, or user actions. Understanding triggers is crucial for comprehending why a run was initiated.

### 5.2 Runs
Runs represent the execution of workflows or automated processes. Each run is associated with a specific trigger and produces outputs that can be analyzed for debugging, optimization, or compliance purposes.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
Triggers, runs, and outputs interact in that a trigger initiates a run, and a run produces outputs. A key constraint is that each run must be associated with exactly one trigger, but a trigger can initiate multiple runs over time.

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for viewing trigger outputs in run history involves storing detailed records of all runs, including their associated triggers and outputs. This model assumes a centralized or distributed logging mechanism that can handle the volume and variety of data produced by runs.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The model assumes that all runs are initiated by triggers, that each run produces outputs, and that there is a reliable mechanism for storing and retrieving run history data.

### 6.3 Invariants
The model must always maintain the integrity of the run history, ensuring that all records are accurate, complete, and tamper-evident. Additionally, the model must support efficient querying and analysis of run history data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern: Trigger-Run-Output Analysis
- **Intent:** To analyze the cause-and-effect relationships between triggers, runs, and outputs for debugging, optimization, or compliance.
- **Context:** This pattern is typically applied during workflow development, testing, or post-execution analysis.
- **Tradeoffs:** This pattern provides deep insights into workflow behavior but may require significant storage and computational resources for large-scale workflows.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern: Ignoring Run History
- **Description:** Failing to store or analyze run history, leading to a lack of visibility into workflow execution and outcomes.
- **Failure Mode:** This anti-pattern can result in undetected errors, inefficient workflows, and compliance issues.
- **Common Causes:** Teams may fall into this anti-pattern due to oversight, lack of resources, or underestimating the importance of run history analysis.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Edge cases include scenarios where triggers are missing, runs produce no outputs, or the run history is partially corrupted. These cases challenge the standard model and require special handling to maintain data integrity and analysis capabilities.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.
