# 5. Polling Interval and API Limits

Canonical documentation for 5. Polling Interval and API Limits. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The topic of Polling Interval and API Limits exists to address the class of problems related to optimizing the frequency of requests to APIs while avoiding excessive usage that may lead to service disruptions, errors, or additional costs. Misunderstanding or inconsistent application of polling intervals and API limits can result in risks such as API throttling, service unavailability, increased latency, and financial penalties. The purpose of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing polling intervals and API limits effectively, ensuring reliable, efficient, and cost-effective interaction with APIs.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of Polling Interval and API Limits involves several major components:
- **Polling Interval**: The time gap between successive requests to an API.
- **API Limits**: The constraints imposed by API providers on the number of requests that can be made within a specified time frame.
- **Request Strategy**: The approach used to manage the frequency and volume of API requests, balancing the need for data freshness with the constraints of API limits.

These components interact to produce outcomes such as optimized data retrieval, minimized latency, and adherence to API usage policies, ultimately ensuring a stable and scalable interaction with APIs.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

Clarify the explicit boundaries of this documentation.

**In scope:**
* Conceptual understanding of polling intervals
* API limit management strategies
* Best practices for optimizing API request frequencies

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations for managing API requests
* Vendor-specific behavior and limitations of APIs
* Operational or procedural guidance for API integration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

Provide precise, stable definitions for all key terms used throughout this document.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Polling Interval | The duration between successive requests to an API to fetch new or updated data. |
| API Limits | The maximum number of requests an API allows within a specified time frame, often imposed to prevent abuse, ensure fair usage, and maintain service quality. |
| Request Strategy | The methodology or approach used to manage how and when API requests are made, considering factors like data freshness, API limits, and system resources. |
| Throttling | The practice of intentionally limiting the rate at which API requests are processed to prevent overload and maintain service availability. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.

### 5.1 Polling Interval Management
Polling interval management involves determining the optimal frequency for making API requests. This concept is crucial as it directly affects the freshness of data and the efficiency of the system. A shorter polling interval can provide more up-to-date information but may lead to hitting API limits more quickly.

### 5.2 API Limit Compliance
API limit compliance refers to the strategies and practices implemented to ensure that API usage does not exceed the limits set by the API provider. This includes understanding the types of limits (e.g., rate limits, quota limits), monitoring API usage, and adjusting the request strategy accordingly.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The polling interval and API limits interact through the request strategy. A shorter polling interval may require more stringent API limit compliance to avoid throttling or service disruptions. Conversely, a longer polling interval may provide more flexibility in managing API limits but could result in less fresh data. Constraints such as network latency, data processing time, and system resources also influence the optimal polling interval and API limit management strategy.

## 6. Standard Model

Describe the generally accepted or recommended model for this topic.

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for managing polling intervals and API limits involves a feedback loop where the system monitors its API usage, adjusts the polling interval based on the API limits and the need for data freshness, and implements strategies to handle cases where API limits are approached or exceeded.

### 6.2 Assumptions
This model assumes that API providers clearly document their limits, that the system has a mechanism to monitor its API usage in real-time, and that adjustments to the polling interval can be made dynamically.

### 6.3 Invariants
The invariants of this model include maintaining API limit compliance at all times, ensuring that the polling interval is adjustable based on system and API conditions, and prioritizing data freshness while avoiding service disruptions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

Document recurring, accepted patterns associated with this topic.

### Pattern: Exponential Backoff
- **Intent:** To handle API rate limiting by gradually increasing the time between requests after hitting the limit.
- **Context:** When an API returns a rate limit error, indicating that the request limit has been exceeded.
- **Tradeoffs:** This pattern helps prevent API throttling but may lead to less fresh data during the backoff period.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

Describe common but discouraged practices.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern: Ignoring API Limits
- **Description:** Failing to implement any strategy for managing API limits, leading to frequent throttling and service disruptions.
- **Failure Mode:** The system becomes unreliable due to constant API errors and service unavailability.
- **Common Causes:** Lack of awareness about API limits, underestimating the volume of API requests, or prioritizing short-term goals over long-term system stability.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Explain unusual or ambiguous scenarios that may challenge the standard model.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.

- **Scenario:** An API has a complex limit structure with both rate limits and quota limits, and the documentation is unclear or incomplete.
- **Challenge:** Determining the optimal polling interval and ensuring compliance with all types of limits without clear guidelines.
- **Approach:** Engage with API support, monitor usage closely, and implement a conservative request strategy to avoid limit violations.
