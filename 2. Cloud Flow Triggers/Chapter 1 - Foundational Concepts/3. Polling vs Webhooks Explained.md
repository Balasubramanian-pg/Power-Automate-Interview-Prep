# 3. Polling vs Webhooks Explained

Canonical documentation for 3. Polling vs Webhooks Explained. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The topic of Polling vs Webhooks Explained exists to address the class of problems related to real-time data synchronization and event-driven communication between systems. The primary issue is how to efficiently and reliably receive updates or notifications from an external system, such as a server or a service. The risks or failures that arise when this topic is misunderstood or inconsistently applied include increased latency, decreased system responsiveness, and wasted resources due to unnecessary requests. Inconsistent application of polling or webhooks can lead to scalability issues, maintainability problems, and incorrect assumptions about system behavior.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The high-level mental model of Polling vs Webhooks Explained consists of two major conceptual components: Polling and Webhooks. Polling refers to the client-initiated approach where a system periodically sends requests to a server to check for updates or changes. Webhooks, on the other hand, represent the server-initiated approach where a server sends notifications to a client when a specific event occurs. These components relate to each other in that they are alternative strategies for achieving real-time data synchronization and event-driven communication. The outcomes the model is designed to produce include efficient use of resources, timely notification of events, and reliable synchronization of data between systems.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

The following terms are defined for use throughout this document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Polling | A client-initiated approach where a system periodically sends requests to a server to check for updates or changes. |
| Webhook | A server-initiated approach where a server sends notifications to a client when a specific event occurs. |
| Event-driven communication | A paradigm where systems communicate with each other in response to specific events or changes. |
| Real-time data synchronization | The process of ensuring that data is up-to-date and consistent across multiple systems in real-time. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

The fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic are:

### 5.1 Polling
Polling is a client-initiated approach where a system periodically sends requests to a server to check for updates or changes. This approach is useful when the client needs to retrieve data from the server at regular intervals. However, polling can be inefficient if the interval is too short, leading to wasted resources and increased latency.

### 5.2 Webhooks
Webhooks are a server-initiated approach where a server sends notifications to a client when a specific event occurs. This approach is useful when the server needs to notify the client of changes or updates in real-time. Webhooks can be more efficient than polling, as they eliminate the need for the client to periodically send requests to the server.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
Polling and webhooks interact with each other in that they are alternative strategies for achieving real-time data synchronization and event-driven communication. The choice between polling and webhooks depends on the specific use case and requirements of the system. Constraints on the choice between polling and webhooks include the frequency of updates, the latency requirements, and the available resources.

## 6. Standard Model

The generally accepted or recommended model for Polling vs Webhooks Explained is as follows:

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model consists of a client and a server, where the client can use either polling or webhooks to receive updates or notifications from the server. The choice between polling and webhooks depends on the specific use case and requirements of the system.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that the client and server are connected via a reliable network, and that the server is capable of sending notifications to the client in real-time.

### 6.3 Invariants
The invariants of the standard model include:

* The client must be able to receive updates or notifications from the server in real-time.
* The server must be able to send notifications to the client when a specific event occurs.
* The choice between polling and webhooks must be based on the specific use case and requirements of the system.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

The following recurring patterns are associated with Polling vs Webhooks Explained:

### Pattern A: Using Polling for Infrequent Updates
- **Intent:** To reduce the number of requests sent to the server when updates are infrequent.
- **Context:** When the frequency of updates is low, and the client can tolerate some latency.
- **Tradeoffs:** Reduced number of requests sent to the server, but increased latency.

### Pattern B: Using Webhooks for Real-time Notifications
- **Intent:** To receive notifications from the server in real-time.
- **Context:** When the client needs to receive updates or notifications from the server in real-time.
- **Tradeoffs:** Increased efficiency and reduced latency, but requires the server to be capable of sending notifications to the client.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

The following common but discouraged practices are associated with Polling vs Webhooks Explained:

### Anti-Pattern A: Using Polling with a Short Interval
- **Description:** Using polling with a short interval, such as every few seconds.
- **Failure Mode:** Wasted resources and increased latency due to the high frequency of requests.
- **Common Causes:** Incorrect assumption that polling with a short interval is necessary for real-time updates.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

The following unusual or ambiguous scenarios may challenge the standard model:

* Handling errors or failures in the communication between the client and server.
* Dealing with changes in the frequency of updates or notifications.
* Supporting multiple clients or servers with different requirements.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.
