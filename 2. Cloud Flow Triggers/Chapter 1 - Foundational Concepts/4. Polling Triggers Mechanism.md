# 4. Polling Triggers Mechanism

Canonical documentation for 4. Polling Triggers Mechanism. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The Polling Triggers Mechanism exists to address the need for efficient and reliable event-driven processing in various systems, particularly in scenarios where real-time notifications are not feasible or practical. This mechanism is designed to handle the class of problems related to periodic checking for new events, updates, or changes in a system, application, or data source. Misunderstanding or inconsistent application of polling triggers can lead to issues such as increased latency, resource waste, and decreased system responsiveness. The risks associated with poor implementation include missed events, duplicated efforts, and inefficient use of system resources.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The Polling Triggers Mechanism is based on a high-level model that involves several major conceptual components:
- **Polling Agent**: The entity responsible for periodically checking for new events or updates.
- **Trigger Condition**: The criteria that define when a polling event should be triggered.
- **Action Handler**: The component that processes the event once it is triggered.

These components interact to produce outcomes such as timely event processing, efficient resource utilization, and reliable system operation. The model is designed to balance between the need for real-time event handling and the constraints imposed by the underlying system or application architecture.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

Provide precise, stable definitions for all key terms used throughout this document.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Polling | The act of periodically checking a system, application, or data source for new events, updates, or changes. |
| Trigger | A condition or set of conditions that, when met, initiate an action or set of actions. |
| Polling Interval | The time gap between two consecutive polling attempts. |
| Trigger Condition | The specific criteria that must be satisfied for a trigger to activate. |
| Action Handler | The component or function responsible for processing the event triggered by the polling mechanism. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.

### 5.1 Polling Agent
The polling agent is the central component of the polling triggers mechanism. It is responsible for initiating the polling process at predefined intervals. The polling agent must be configurable to accommodate different polling intervals and trigger conditions.

### 5.2 Trigger Condition
The trigger condition defines the criteria under which a polling event is considered valid and should trigger an action. This can include specific data values, changes in state, or the presence of new data. The trigger condition is crucial for ensuring that the polling mechanism only activates when necessary, thus optimizing resource usage.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The polling agent, trigger condition, and action handler interact in a way that the polling agent periodically checks for the trigger condition. If the condition is met, the polling agent activates the action handler to process the event. Constraints include the polling interval, which must be balanced between being frequent enough to capture events in a timely manner and not so frequent as to waste resources. Another constraint is the complexity of the trigger condition, which should be simple enough to evaluate efficiently but comprehensive enough to capture all relevant events.

## 6. Standard Model

Describe the generally accepted or recommended model for this topic.

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for the polling triggers mechanism involves a polling agent that checks a system or data source at regular intervals defined by the polling interval. Upon each check, it evaluates the trigger condition. If the condition is satisfied, the polling agent invokes the action handler, which then processes the event. This model ensures a balance between responsiveness and resource efficiency.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that the polling interval can be adjusted based on the expected frequency of events and the system's resource constraints. It also assumes that the trigger condition can be clearly defined and efficiently evaluated.

### 6.3 Invariants
The invariants of the standard model include:
- The polling agent must always check the trigger condition at the specified polling interval.
- The action handler is only invoked when the trigger condition is met.
- The polling mechanism does not modify the underlying system or data source except through the action handler.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

Document recurring, accepted patterns associated with this topic.

### Pattern A: Adaptive Polling
- **Intent:** Adjust the polling interval based on the frequency of events to optimize resource usage.
- **Context:** Systems where event frequency varies significantly over time.
- **Tradeoffs:** Between responsiveness and resource efficiency, as more frequent polling can capture events sooner but at a higher resource cost.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

Describe common but discouraged practices.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern A: Over-Polling
- **Description:** Polling at an interval that is too short for the system to handle, leading to wasted resources and potential system overload.
- **Failure Mode:** System becomes unresponsive or crashes due to excessive polling.
- **Common Causes:** Incorrect assumptions about the required responsiveness or failure to consider system resource limitations.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Explain unusual or ambiguous scenarios that may challenge the standard model.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.

- **Initial Condition:** The system starts with no events or an unknown state, requiring special handling for the first polling interval.
- **Trigger Condition Ambiguity:** Situations where the trigger condition is not clearly defined or can be met in multiple ways, requiring additional logic to handle correctly.
