# 1. The Foundational Concepts of Triggers

Canonical documentation for 1. The Foundational Concepts of Triggers. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The concept of triggers exists to address the need for automated responses to specific events or conditions within a system. Triggers are designed to simplify complex workflows, improve system efficiency, and reduce manual intervention. The class of problems triggers address includes event-driven processing, real-time notifications, and automated task execution. Misunderstanding or inconsistent application of trigger concepts can lead to errors, inefficiencies, or even system failures. For instance, poorly designed triggers can cause unnecessary resource consumption, lead to data inconsistencies, or result in unintended actions.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of triggers consists of three major components: events, conditions, and actions. Events are occurrences within a system that can initiate a trigger, such as data updates or user interactions. Conditions are criteria that must be met for a trigger to execute, which can include specific data values, system states, or time constraints. Actions are the responses or operations performed when a trigger is activated, which can range from simple notifications to complex workflows. The trigger model is designed to produce outcomes such as automated task execution, real-time data processing, and enhanced system responsiveness.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

**In scope:**
* Trigger design principles
* Trigger implementation patterns
* Best practices for trigger management

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations
* Vendor-specific behavior
* Operational or procedural guidance

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

Provide precise, stable definitions for all key terms used throughout this document.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Trigger | A mechanism that automatically initiates an action in response to a specific event or condition. |
| Event | An occurrence within a system that can initiate a trigger, such as a data update or user interaction. |
| Condition | A criterion that must be met for a trigger to execute, such as a specific data value or system state. |
| Action | The response or operation performed when a trigger is activated, such as a notification or workflow execution. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.

### 5.1 Events
Events are the foundation of trigger systems, as they provide the stimuli for automated actions. Events can be categorized into different types, such as system events (e.g., startup, shutdown), user events (e.g., login, logout), or data events (e.g., insert, update, delete).

### 5.2 Conditions
Conditions are essential for ensuring that triggers execute only when necessary. Conditions can be based on various factors, including data values, system states, or time constraints. Well-designed conditions help prevent unnecessary trigger executions, reducing system overhead and improving overall efficiency.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
Triggers, events, and conditions interact in complex ways, with constraints and dependencies governing their behavior. For example, a trigger may require a specific event to occur and a particular condition to be met before executing an action. Understanding these interactions and constraints is crucial for designing effective trigger systems.

## 6. Standard Model

Describe the generally accepted or recommended model for this topic.

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard trigger model consists of a trigger definition, which specifies the event, condition, and action. The trigger definition is then registered with the system, which monitors for the specified event and evaluates the condition when the event occurs. If the condition is met, the system executes the specified action.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that the system has a reliable event detection mechanism, a robust condition evaluation framework, and a secure action execution environment.

### 6.3 Invariants
The standard model has several invariants, including:
* Triggers are executed in a consistent and predictable manner.
* Events are detected and processed in a timely and reliable fashion.
* Conditions are evaluated accurately and efficiently.
* Actions are executed with the necessary permissions and access controls.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

Document recurring, accepted patterns associated with this topic.

### Pattern A: Event-Driven Processing
- **Intent:** Automate processing of events in real-time.
- **Context:** Systems that require immediate response to events, such as financial transactions or security alerts.
- **Tradeoffs:** Increased system complexity, potential for event overload, and higher resource utilization.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

Describe common but discouraged practices.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern A: Overly Complex Triggers
- **Description:** Triggers with intricate conditions or actions that are difficult to understand or maintain.
- **Failure Mode:** Triggers that are prone to errors, difficult to debug, or lead to unexpected behavior.
- **Common Causes:** Lack of clear requirements, inadequate testing, or insufficient documentation.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Explain unusual or ambiguous scenarios that may challenge the standard model.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.

Edge cases include scenarios where events are missed or duplicated, conditions are ambiguous or conflicting, or actions are incomplete or inconsistent. Boundary conditions, such as system startup or shutdown, can also pose challenges to trigger systems.
