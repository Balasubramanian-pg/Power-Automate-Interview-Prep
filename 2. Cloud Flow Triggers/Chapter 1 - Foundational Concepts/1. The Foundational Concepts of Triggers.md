# 1. The Foundational Concepts of Triggers

Canonical documentation for 1. The Foundational Concepts of Triggers. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The concept of triggers exists to address the need for automated responses to specific events or conditions within systems, applications, or databases. Triggers are designed to execute predefined actions when certain criteria are met, ensuring data consistency, enforcing business rules, and streamlining processes. The class of problems triggers address includes data integrity, compliance, and automation. Misunderstanding or inconsistent application of triggers can lead to data inconsistencies, security vulnerabilities, and system failures.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of triggers consists of three major components: events, conditions, and actions. Events are the stimuli that activate triggers, such as insert, update, or delete operations. Conditions are the criteria that must be met for the trigger to execute, which can include specific data values, user identities, or system states. Actions are the predefined responses that the trigger executes when the conditions are met, such as updating related data, sending notifications, or logging events. The outcomes of this model are to ensure data consistency, enforce business rules, and automate processes.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

Clarify the explicit boundaries of this documentation.

**In scope:**
* Trigger types (e.g., before, after, instead of)
* Trigger components (e.g., events, conditions, actions)
* Trigger usage patterns (e.g., data validation, audit logging)

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations (e.g., database management systems, programming languages)
* Vendor-specific behavior (e.g., proprietary trigger features)
* Operational or procedural guidance (e.g., trigger maintenance, troubleshooting)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

Provide precise, stable definitions for all key terms used throughout this document.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Trigger | A set of instructions that automatically execute in response to a specific event or condition. |
| Event | A stimulus that activates a trigger, such as an insert, update, or delete operation. |
| Condition | A criterion that must be met for a trigger to execute, such as a specific data value or system state. |
| Action | A predefined response that a trigger executes when the conditions are met, such as updating related data or sending notifications. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.

### 5.1 Trigger Types
Triggers can be classified into different types based on when they execute relative to the event that activates them. The most common types are before, after, and instead of triggers. Before triggers execute before the event, after triggers execute after the event, and instead of triggers replace the event.

### 5.2 Trigger Components
Trigger components include events, conditions, and actions. Events are the stimuli that activate triggers, conditions are the criteria that must be met for the trigger to execute, and actions are the predefined responses that the trigger executes when the conditions are met.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
Trigger components interact in a specific way. Events activate triggers, conditions filter the execution of triggers, and actions respond to the events. Constraints, such as data consistency and security, must be considered when designing triggers to ensure that they operate correctly and do not introduce vulnerabilities.

## 6. Standard Model

Describe the generally accepted or recommended model for this topic.

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for triggers consists of a trigger definition, which includes the trigger type, event, condition, and action. The trigger definition is used to create a trigger instance, which is then executed by the system when the event occurs.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that the system has a clear understanding of the events, conditions, and actions that are relevant to the trigger. It also assumes that the system has the necessary resources and permissions to execute the trigger.

### 6.3 Invariants
The standard model has several invariants that must always hold true. These include:
* Triggers must be defined before they can be executed.
* Triggers must have a clear and unambiguous event, condition, and action.
* Triggers must be executed in a consistent and predictable manner.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

Document recurring, accepted patterns associated with this topic.

### Pattern A: Data Validation
- **Intent:** Ensure data consistency and accuracy by validating user input.
- **Context:** Typically applied during data insertion or update operations.
- **Tradeoffs:** May introduce additional processing overhead, but ensures data quality and reduces errors.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

Describe common but discouraged practices.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern A: Overly Complex Triggers
- **Description:** Triggers that are overly complex, with multiple conditions and actions, can be difficult to maintain and debug.
- **Failure Mode:** Can lead to errors, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities.
- **Common Causes:** Lack of clear requirements, inadequate testing, and insufficient documentation.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Explain unusual or ambiguous scenarios that may challenge the standard model.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.

### Edge Case A: Trigger Cascades
Trigger cascades occur when a trigger executes another trigger, which can lead to unpredictable behavior and performance issues. To handle trigger cascades, it is essential to carefully design and test triggers to ensure that they do not create infinite loops or other issues.
