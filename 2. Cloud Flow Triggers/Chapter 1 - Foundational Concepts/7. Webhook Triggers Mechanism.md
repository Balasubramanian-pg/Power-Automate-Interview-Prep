# 7. Webhook Triggers Mechanism

Canonical documentation for 7. Webhook Triggers Mechanism. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The Webhook Triggers Mechanism exists to provide a standardized method for triggering events in response to specific occurrences within a system or application. This topic addresses the class of problems related to real-time notification and event-driven architecture, where the ability to reliably and efficiently trigger actions in response to changes or updates is crucial. The risks or failures that arise when this mechanism is misunderstood or inconsistently applied include missed notifications, delayed responses, and potential data inconsistencies.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The Webhook Triggers Mechanism conceptual model consists of three major components: 
1. **Event Sources**: These are the systems, applications, or services that generate events.
2. **Webhook Endpoints**: These are the URLs or interfaces that receive event notifications.
3. **Trigger Mechanism**: This is the logic that determines when and how events are sent to webhook endpoints.

These components relate to one another in that event sources generate events, which are then evaluated by the trigger mechanism to determine if a notification should be sent to a webhook endpoint. The outcome of this model is designed to produce real-time, event-driven interactions between systems, enabling efficient and scalable communication.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

Clarify the explicit boundaries of this documentation.

**In scope:**
* Webhook endpoint configuration
* Event source integration
* Trigger mechanism logic

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations
* Vendor-specific behavior
* Operational or procedural guidance

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

Provide precise, stable definitions for all key terms used throughout this document.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Webhook | A callback function that is triggered by a specific event. |
| Event Source | The system, application, or service that generates events. |
| Trigger Mechanism | The logic that determines when and how events are sent to webhook endpoints. |
| Webhook Endpoint | The URL or interface that receives event notifications. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.

### 5.1 Event Sources
Event sources are the originators of events. They can be applications, services, or systems that generate events in response to specific occurrences, such as user actions, system changes, or scheduled tasks.

### 5.2 Webhook Endpoints
Webhook endpoints are the destinations for event notifications. They are typically URLs or interfaces that can receive and process HTTP requests containing event data.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The core concepts interact in that event sources generate events, which are then evaluated by the trigger mechanism. The trigger mechanism determines if the event should be sent to a webhook endpoint based on predefined rules or conditions. Constraints include ensuring that webhook endpoints are properly configured to receive and process event notifications, and that the trigger mechanism is correctly implemented to handle various event types and frequencies.

## 6. Standard Model

Describe the generally accepted or recommended model for this topic.

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for the Webhook Triggers Mechanism involves the following steps:
1. Event generation by the event source.
2. Event evaluation by the trigger mechanism.
3. Notification sending to the webhook endpoint if the event meets the trigger conditions.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that:
- Event sources are capable of generating events in a format compatible with the trigger mechanism.
- Webhook endpoints are properly configured and can receive and process event notifications.
- The trigger mechanism is correctly implemented and can evaluate events against predefined rules.

### 6.3 Invariants
The following properties must always hold true within the standard model:
- Events are generated by event sources.
- The trigger mechanism evaluates events against predefined rules.
- Webhook endpoints receive event notifications if the trigger conditions are met.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

Document recurring, accepted patterns associated with this topic.

### Pattern A: Event Filtering
- **Intent:** Reduce the number of events sent to webhook endpoints by filtering out irrelevant events.
- **Context:** When the volume of events is high, and not all events require immediate action.
- **Tradeoffs:** Reduced network traffic and improved endpoint performance, but potentially delayed response to critical events if filtering criteria are not carefully defined.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

Describe common but discouraged practices.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern A: Hardcoded Webhook Endpoints
- **Description:** Webhook endpoints are hardcoded into the event source or trigger mechanism.
- **Failure Mode:** Makes it difficult to change or update webhook endpoints without modifying the underlying code, leading to inflexibility and potential errors.
- **Common Causes:** Lack of planning for scalability and flexibility, or insufficient understanding of the importance of loose coupling between components.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Explain unusual or ambiguous scenarios that may challenge the standard model.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.

### Edge Case: Event Source Failure
In the event of an event source failure, the trigger mechanism may not receive events, leading to a lack of notifications being sent to webhook endpoints. This scenario requires careful handling to ensure that missed events are properly processed once the event source is restored.
