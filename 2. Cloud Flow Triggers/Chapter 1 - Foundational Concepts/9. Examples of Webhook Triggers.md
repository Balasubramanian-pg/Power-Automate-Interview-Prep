# 9. Examples of Webhook Triggers

Canonical documentation for 9. Examples of Webhook Triggers. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The topic of webhook triggers exists to address the need for automated, real-time notifications and actions in response to specific events or changes within a system or application. The class of problems it addresses includes the requirement for efficient, scalable, and reliable communication between disparate systems, services, or applications. The risks or failures that arise when webhook triggers are misunderstood or inconsistently applied include missed notifications, delayed responses, data inconsistencies, and security vulnerabilities.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of webhook triggers consists of three major components: the event source, the webhook endpoint, and the trigger action. The event source generates events that trigger notifications, the webhook endpoint receives and processes these notifications, and the trigger action executes a specific response or set of responses to the event. These components relate to one another through a publish-subscribe pattern, where the event source publishes events to the webhook endpoint, which then triggers the corresponding action. The outcome of this model is to enable real-time, automated communication and response to events, promoting efficiency, scalability, and reliability in system interactions.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

The scope of this documentation includes:

**In scope:**
* Conceptual models of webhook triggers
* Terminology and definitions related to webhook triggers
* Core concepts and standard models for webhook triggers
* Common patterns and anti-patterns in the use of webhook triggers

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations of webhook triggers
* Vendor-specific behavior or configurations
* Operational or procedural guidance for setting up or managing webhook triggers

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

The following terms are defined for the purpose of this documentation:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Webhook | A callback function that is triggered by a specific event, sending a notification to a predefined endpoint. |
| Trigger | An event or condition that initiates the execution of a webhook. |
| Endpoint | The URL or API endpoint that receives the webhook notification. |
| Event Source | The system, application, or service that generates the events triggering the webhook. |
| Trigger Action | The response or set of responses executed as a result of the webhook trigger. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Webhook Endpoint
The webhook endpoint is the recipient of the webhook notification, responsible for processing the event data and triggering the appropriate action. It must be capable of handling HTTP requests and parsing the event data.

### 5.2 Event Source
The event source is the originator of the events that trigger the webhook. It can be any system, application, or service capable of generating events and sending notifications to the webhook endpoint.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The webhook endpoint and event source interact through the webhook protocol, which defines the format and structure of the event data and the notification mechanism. Constraints include the requirement for the webhook endpoint to be accessible and capable of processing the event data in real-time, as well as the need for the event source to generate events in a format compatible with the webhook endpoint.

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for webhook triggers involves the event source generating an event, which triggers a notification sent to the webhook endpoint. The webhook endpoint processes the event data and executes the trigger action, which can include sending notifications, updating databases, or triggering additional workflows.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that the event source and webhook endpoint are capable of communicating through a common protocol, that the webhook endpoint is accessible and can process event data in real-time, and that the trigger action is defined and executable.

### 6.3 Invariants
The invariants of the standard model include the requirement that the event source generates events in a consistent and predictable manner, that the webhook endpoint processes event data correctly and in real-time, and that the trigger action is executed as defined and expected.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern: Event-Driven Architecture
- **Intent:** To enable real-time, automated communication and response to events across disparate systems or applications.
- **Context:** When integrating multiple systems or services that require real-time notifications and actions.
- **Tradeoffs:** Enables scalability and flexibility but may introduce complexity in event management and trigger action execution.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern: Tight Coupling
- **Description:** Implementing webhook triggers with tightly coupled event sources and webhook endpoints, limiting flexibility and scalability.
- **Failure Mode:** Leads to brittleness and rigidity in the system, making it difficult to adapt to changes or integrate new components.
- **Common Causes:** Overemphasis on simplicity and ease of implementation, underestimating the need for flexibility and scalability.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Edge cases include scenarios where the event source generates events at a rate exceeding the webhook endpoint's capacity to process them, or where the trigger action depends on external services that are temporarily unavailable. Boundary conditions include the maximum number of events that can be processed within a given timeframe, the minimum latency required for real-time responses, and the maximum payload size that can be handled by the webhook endpoint.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.
