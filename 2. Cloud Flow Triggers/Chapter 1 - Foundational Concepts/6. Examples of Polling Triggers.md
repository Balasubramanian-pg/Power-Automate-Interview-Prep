# 6. Examples of Polling Triggers

Canonical documentation for 6. Examples of Polling Triggers. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

Polling triggers are a crucial component in various systems, particularly in event-driven architectures, where they enable the detection of changes or the occurrence of specific conditions. The purpose of polling triggers is to provide a mechanism for periodically checking the state of a system or resource, allowing for timely responses to changes or events. The problem space addressed by polling triggers includes the need for efficient and reliable event detection, the management of system resources, and the minimization of latency in response to events. Misunderstanding or inconsistent application of polling triggers can lead to issues such as increased resource utilization, delayed event detection, and decreased system responsiveness.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of polling triggers consists of several major components:
- **Trigger**: The mechanism that initiates the polling process.
- **Polling Interval**: The time period between successive polls.
- **Condition**: The specific state or event that the polling process is checking for.
- **Action**: The response or set of responses triggered when the condition is met.

These components relate to one another in the following way: the trigger initiates the polling process, which checks the condition at regular intervals (defined by the polling interval). When the condition is met, the specified action is executed. The outcome of this model is to provide a flexible and efficient way to detect and respond to events or changes in a system.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

Clarify the explicit boundaries of this documentation.

**In scope:**
* Conceptual model of polling triggers
* Terminology and definitions related to polling triggers
* Standard usage patterns and best practices

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations of polling triggers
* Vendor-specific behavior or configurations
* Operational or procedural guidance for managing polling triggers in production environments

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

Provide precise, stable definitions for all key terms used throughout this document.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Polling Trigger | A mechanism that periodically checks for a specific condition or event. |
| Polling Interval | The time period between successive polls. |
| Trigger Condition | The specific state or event that the polling process is checking for. |
| Trigger Action | The response or set of responses executed when the trigger condition is met. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.

### 5.1 Trigger Mechanism
The trigger mechanism is the component responsible for initiating the polling process. It can be based on various factors, including time intervals, system events, or external signals.

### 5.2 Polling Interval Management
Effective management of the polling interval is crucial for balancing between responsiveness and resource utilization. A shorter polling interval can lead to quicker detection of events but may increase system load, while a longer interval may reduce system load but can delay event detection.

### 5.3 Condition and Action Interactions
The condition and action components interact in a way that the condition defines what is being checked for, and the action defines the response when the condition is met. This interaction is fundamental to the polling trigger's functionality and must be carefully configured to ensure the desired system behavior.

## 6. Standard Model

Describe the generally accepted or recommended model for this topic.

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for polling triggers involves a periodic check (based on the polling interval) for a specific condition. When the condition is detected, the predefined action is triggered. This model is designed to be flexible and adaptable to various scenarios, from simple event detection to complex workflow automation.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that:
- The polling interval can be accurately controlled.
- The condition can be reliably detected.
- The action can be successfully executed.

### 6.3 Invariants
The following properties must always hold true within the standard model:
- The polling trigger must initiate the polling process at the specified interval.
- The condition must be checked at each polling interval.
- The action must be executed when the condition is met.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

Document recurring, accepted patterns associated with this topic.

### Pattern: Scheduled Polling
- **Intent:** To detect events or changes at regular, predictable intervals.
- **Context:** Useful in scenarios where the timing of events is known or can be anticipated.
- **Tradeoffs:** Offers predictability but may not be suitable for real-time event detection.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

Describe common but discouraged practices.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern: Over-Polling
- **Description:** Setting the polling interval too short, leading to excessive system checks.
- **Failure Mode:** Increased system load, potential for missed events due to overwhelming the system.
- **Common Causes:** Misjudging the required responsiveness or not considering system resource limitations.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Explain unusual or ambiguous scenarios that may challenge the standard model.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.

- **Scenario:** The polling interval is set to a value that is not a divisor of the system's clock resolution, leading to drift over time.
- **Impact:** The polling trigger may eventually desynchronize with the expected timing, affecting its reliability.
