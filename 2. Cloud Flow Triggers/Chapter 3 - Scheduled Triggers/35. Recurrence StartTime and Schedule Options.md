# 35. Recurrence StartTime and Schedule Options

Canonical documentation for 35. Recurrence StartTime and Schedule Options. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The topic of Recurrence StartTime and Schedule Options exists to address the complexities and nuances of scheduling recurring events or tasks. This class of problems arises in various domains, including calendar management, workflow automation, and resource allocation. The risks or failures that arise when recurrence start time and schedule options are misunderstood or inconsistently applied include incorrect scheduling, overlapping events, and resource conflicts. Inconsistent application of these concepts can lead to errors, inefficiencies, and frustration among users.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of Recurrence StartTime and Schedule Options consists of three major components: recurrence patterns, start time, and schedule options. Recurrence patterns define the frequency and interval of recurring events, such as daily, weekly, or monthly. Start time specifies the initial time of the recurring event, while schedule options determine the duration, time zone, and other constraints. These components relate to one another in that the recurrence pattern and start time together define the schedule of the recurring event, and the schedule options refine and constrain this schedule. The outcome of this model is to produce a well-defined and unambiguous schedule for recurring events.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

The scope of this documentation includes:

**In scope:**
* Recurrence patterns and their definitions
* Start time and its relationship to recurrence patterns
* Schedule options and their constraints

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations of recurrence start time and schedule options
* Vendor-specific behavior or proprietary algorithms
* Operational or procedural guidance for using recurrence start time and schedule options in specific contexts

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

The following terms are defined for use throughout this document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Recurrence Pattern | A rule or formula that defines the frequency and interval of a recurring event |
| Start Time | The initial time of a recurring event |
| Schedule Option | A constraint or parameter that refines or modifies the schedule of a recurring event |
| Time Zone | A region or area that follows a uniform standard time |
| Duration | The length of time that a recurring event lasts |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Recurrence Patterns
Recurrence patterns are the foundation of scheduling recurring events. They define the frequency and interval of the event, such as daily, weekly, or monthly. Recurrence patterns can be simple, such as "every day," or complex, such as "every Monday and Thursday."

### 5.2 Start Time
Start time is the initial time of the recurring event. It is used in conjunction with the recurrence pattern to determine the schedule of the event. Start time can be specified in a variety of formats, including absolute time, relative time, or time zone-dependent time.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The core concepts of recurrence patterns, start time, and schedule options interact in complex ways. For example, the recurrence pattern and start time together define the schedule of the recurring event, while the schedule options refine and constrain this schedule. Constraints, such as time zone or duration, can also affect the schedule of the event.

## 6. Standard Model

The standard model for Recurrence StartTime and Schedule Options is based on the iCalendar (RFC 5545) specification. This model defines a set of rules and constraints for scheduling recurring events.

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model consists of three components: recurrence patterns, start time, and schedule options. Recurrence patterns are defined using a set of rules, such as "every day" or "every Monday and Thursday." Start time is specified using a timestamp, and schedule options are defined using a set of constraints, such as time zone or duration.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that the recurrence pattern and start time are well-defined and unambiguous. It also assumes that the schedule options are consistent and do not conflict with one another.

### 6.3 Invariants
The standard model defines several invariants, including:

* The recurrence pattern and start time together define a unique schedule for the recurring event.
* The schedule options refine and constrain the schedule of the recurring event, but do not change its underlying pattern.
* The time zone and duration of the recurring event are consistent and do not conflict with one another.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

Several common patterns are associated with Recurrence StartTime and Schedule Options:

### Pattern A: Daily Recurrence
- **Intent:** Schedule a recurring event to occur every day at the same time.
- **Context:** This pattern is typically used for daily meetings or tasks.
- **Tradeoffs:** This pattern is simple and easy to implement, but may not be suitable for events that require a more complex recurrence pattern.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

Several anti-patterns are associated with Recurrence StartTime and Schedule Options:

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern A: Inconsistent Time Zones
- **Description:** Using inconsistent time zones for the start time and schedule options of a recurring event.
- **Failure Mode:** This anti-pattern can cause the recurring event to be scheduled at the wrong time or to overlap with other events.
- **Common Causes:** This anti-pattern can occur when the time zone is not properly specified or when the schedule options are not consistent with the start time.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Several edge cases and boundary conditions are associated with Recurrence StartTime and Schedule Options:

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.

* Handling daylight saving time (DST) transitions
* Scheduling recurring events across multiple time zones
* Handling conflicts between recurring events and one-time events
