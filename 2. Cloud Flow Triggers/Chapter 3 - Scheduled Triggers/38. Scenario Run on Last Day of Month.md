# 38. Scenario Run on Last Day of Month

Canonical documentation for 38. Scenario Run on Last Day of Month. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The Scenario Run on Last Day of Month topic exists to address the class of problems related to scheduling and executing specific scenarios or tasks on the last day of each month. This is crucial for various applications, including financial reporting, billing cycles, and system maintenance, where timely execution of tasks is essential. Misunderstanding or inconsistent application of this concept can lead to missed deadlines, data inconsistencies, or system failures, resulting in financial losses, reputational damage, or compromised system integrity.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of Scenario Run on Last Day of Month involves several key components:
- **Scheduling Mechanism:** A system or process that determines the last day of each month.
- **Scenario or Task:** The specific action or set of actions to be executed on the last day of the month.
- **Triggering Event:** The event or condition that initiates the execution of the scenario or task.
- **Execution Engine:** The component responsible for carrying out the scenario or task as scheduled.

These components interact to ensure that scenarios or tasks are executed on the last day of each month, producing outcomes such as up-to-date financial reports, accurate billing, and maintained system performance.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

Clarify the explicit boundaries of this documentation.

**In scope:**

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

Provide precise, stable definitions for all key terms used throughout this document.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Last Day of Month | The final day of a calendar month, which can vary from 28 to 31 days depending on the month and year. |
| Scenario | A predefined set of actions or tasks designed to achieve a specific outcome or set of outcomes. |
| Scheduling Mechanism | A system, process, or algorithm used to determine the timing of events, such as the last day of the month. |
| Triggering Event | An event, condition, or signal that initiates the execution of a scenario or task. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.

### 5.1 Scheduling Mechanism
The scheduling mechanism is crucial for accurately determining the last day of each month. This can involve calendar calculations, considering leap years, and accounting for varying month lengths.

### 5.2 Scenario or Task
The scenario or task to be executed is defined based on the specific requirements of the application or system. This could range from generating financial reports to performing system backups.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The scheduling mechanism, scenario or task, and triggering event interact to ensure timely execution. Constraints include ensuring the scheduling mechanism accurately identifies the last day of the month and that the scenario or task is properly defined and executable within the given timeframe.

## 6. Standard Model

Describe the generally accepted or recommended model for this topic.

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model involves a scheduling mechanism that identifies the last day of the month and triggers the execution of a predefined scenario or task. This model assumes a reliable and accurate scheduling mechanism and well-defined scenarios or tasks.

### 6.2 Assumptions
Assumptions under which the model is valid include:
- The scheduling mechanism has access to accurate calendar data.
- The scenario or task is correctly defined and executable.
- The execution engine is capable of running the scenario or task as scheduled.

### 6.3 Invariants
Properties that must always hold true within the model include:
- The scheduling mechanism correctly identifies the last day of the month.
- The scenario or task is executed on the last day of the month as scheduled.
- The execution engine reports the outcome of the scenario or task execution.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

Document recurring, accepted patterns associated with this topic.

### Pattern A: Monthly Financial Reporting
- **Intent:** Automate the generation of financial reports on the last day of each month.
- **Context:** Typically applied in financial management systems.
- **Tradeoffs:** Automates report generation but requires accurate and up-to-date financial data.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

Describe common but discouraged practices.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern A: Hard-Coded Dates
- **Description:** Using fixed dates instead of a dynamic scheduling mechanism.
- **Failure Mode:** Fails to account for varying month lengths and leap years.
- **Common Causes:** Lack of understanding of dynamic scheduling mechanisms or oversimplification of the problem.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Explain unusual or ambiguous scenarios that may challenge the standard model.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.

- **Leap Year:** The scheduling mechanism must correctly handle February in leap years.
- **Month-Length Variability:** The mechanism must account for months with 28, 29, 30, or 31 days.
