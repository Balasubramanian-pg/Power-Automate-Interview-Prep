# 37. Scenario Run Every Weekday Morning

Canonical documentation for 37. Scenario Run Every Weekday Morning. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The Scenario Run Every Weekday Morning topic exists to address the need for automated and consistent execution of predefined scenarios or tasks on a regular, weekday basis. This class of problems is particularly relevant in environments where repetitive tasks, such as data backups, report generation, or system checks, need to be performed without manual intervention to ensure efficiency and reliability. The risks or failures that arise when this concept is misunderstood or inconsistently applied include missed executions, data inconsistencies, and potential system vulnerabilities due to lack of regular maintenance.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The high-level mental model of the Scenario Run Every Weekday Morning concept involves several major components:
- **Scheduling System**: Responsible for managing and triggering the execution of scenarios at specified times.
- **Scenario Definition**: The actual tasks or sets of tasks that are to be executed.
- **Execution Environment**: The context in which the scenarios are run, including any necessary resources or dependencies.
These components interact to produce outcomes such as automated task execution, logging, and notification mechanisms to ensure that weekday morning scenarios are consistently and reliably executed.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

The explicit boundaries of this documentation are as follows:

**In scope:**
* Conceptual models for weekday morning scenario execution
* Terminology and definitions related to automated scenario execution
* Core concepts and standard models for scheduling and executing scenarios

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations for scenario execution (e.g., cron jobs, Windows Task Scheduler)
* Vendor-specific behavior or configurations
* Operational or procedural guidance for setting up and managing scenario execution environments

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

The following terms are defined for clarity and consistency throughout this document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Scenario | A predefined set of tasks or actions designed to achieve a specific outcome. |
| Scheduling System | A mechanism or service responsible for triggering the execution of scenarios at specified times or intervals. |
| Execution Environment | The context, including hardware, software, and network resources, in which scenarios are executed. |
| Weekday Morning | The time period from Monday to Friday, typically during the early morning hours, when scenarios are scheduled to run. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions are crafted to be timeless and applicable across various implementations and technologies.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Scheduling
Scheduling refers to the process of planning and triggering the execution of scenarios at specific times or intervals. In the context of Scenario Run Every Weekday Morning, scheduling is critical for ensuring that predefined tasks are automatically executed during weekday mornings.

### 5.2 Scenario Definition
A scenario definition encompasses the detailed description of the tasks, including any prerequisites, dependencies, and expected outcomes. This definition is crucial for the consistent and reliable execution of scenarios.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The scheduling system, scenario definition, and execution environment interact closely. The scheduling system must be able to interpret the scenario definition and execute it within the execution environment. Constraints include ensuring that the execution environment has the necessary resources and dependencies to successfully run the scenario.

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for Scenario Run Every Weekday Morning involves a scheduling system that triggers the execution of predefined scenarios during weekday mornings. The model assumes a robust execution environment capable of handling the scenarios as defined.

### 6.2 Assumptions
Assumptions under which the model is valid include:
- The scheduling system is correctly configured and operational.
- The execution environment is adequately resourced and maintained.
- Scenario definitions are accurate and up-to-date.

### 6.3 Invariants
Properties that must always hold true within the model include:
- Scenarios are executed consistently at the scheduled weekday morning times.
- The execution environment remains stable and capable of supporting scenario execution.
- Logging and notification mechanisms are in place to report execution outcomes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified to ensure maintainability and scalability.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern: Daily Backup
- **Intent:** Ensure data integrity by performing daily backups.
- **Context:** Applied in environments where data loss could have significant impacts.
- **Tradeoffs:** Storage requirements vs. data recovery capabilities.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern: Manual Execution
- **Description:** Relying on manual execution of scenarios instead of automating them.
- **Failure Mode:** Inconsistent execution, potential for human error, and increased workload.
- **Common Causes:** Lack of automation tools, insufficient training, or underestimating the benefits of automation.

> [!WARNING]
> Anti-patterns like manual execution can lead to significant maintainability and reliability issues.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Edge cases include scenarios that require execution outside the standard weekday morning window, such as one-time tasks or scenarios triggered by specific events rather than time. Boundary conditions may involve scenarios that have dependencies on external systems or resources that may not always be available during the scheduled execution time.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases and boundary conditions require careful consideration to ensure the robustness of the scenario execution model.
