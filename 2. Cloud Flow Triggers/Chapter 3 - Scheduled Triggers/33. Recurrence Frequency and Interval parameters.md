# 33. Recurrence Frequency and Interval parameters

Canonical documentation for 33. Recurrence Frequency and Interval parameters. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The Recurrence Frequency and Interval parameters topic exists to address the class of problems related to scheduling and repeating events or tasks. This includes scenarios where events need to occur at regular intervals, such as daily, weekly, or monthly, and where the frequency and interval of these events must be precisely defined to ensure correct execution or scheduling. Misunderstanding or inconsistent application of recurrence frequency and interval parameters can lead to errors in scheduling, missed events, or incorrect automation of tasks, resulting in operational inefficiencies, data inconsistencies, or loss of productivity.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of Recurrence Frequency and Interval parameters involves several key components:
- **Recurrence**: The concept of an event or task repeating over time.
- **Frequency**: How often the event or task recurs, such as daily, weekly, etc.
- **Interval**: The specific time span between recurrences, which can be combined with frequency (e.g., every 2 weeks).
- **Start and End Conditions**: Parameters that define when the recurrence starts and stops, including specific dates or after a certain number of occurrences.

These components interact to produce a schedule or pattern of events that can be used in various applications, from calendar systems to automated task management.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

Clarify the explicit boundaries of this documentation.

**In scope:**
* Conceptual model of recurrence frequency and interval parameters
* Terminology and definitions related to recurrence and scheduling
* Standard usage patterns and models for applying recurrence parameters

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations of recurrence frequency and interval parameters
* Vendor-specific behavior or proprietary scheduling algorithms
* Operational or procedural guidance for managing scheduled events or tasks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

Provide precise, stable definitions for all key terms used throughout this document.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Recurrence | The repetition of an event or task over time according to a defined schedule or pattern. |
| Frequency | The rate at which an event or task recurs, such as daily, weekly, monthly, etc. |
| Interval | The time span between recurrences of an event or task, which can be specified in units of time (e.g., every 2 weeks). |
| Start Condition | The parameter that defines when the recurrence of an event or task begins, which can be a specific date, time, or event. |
| End Condition | The parameter that defines when the recurrence of an event or task stops, which can be after a certain number of occurrences, on a specific date, or never. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.

### 5.1 Recurrence
Recurrence is the foundational concept, representing the repetition of events or tasks. It is defined by its frequency and interval, which together determine the schedule or pattern of repetition.

### 5.2 Frequency and Interval
Frequency and interval are interrelated concepts that specify how often and when an event or task recurs. The frequency (e.g., daily) can be combined with an interval (e.g., every 2 days) to create a specific recurrence pattern.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The core concepts interact through the scheduling algorithm, which applies the recurrence parameters to generate a sequence of event or task instances. Constraints, such as start and end conditions, further refine this sequence. For example, a daily recurrence with a start condition of Monday and an end condition of Friday would result in a sequence of events occurring only on weekdays.

## 6. Standard Model

Describe the generally accepted or recommended model for this topic.

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for recurrence frequency and interval parameters involves a hierarchical structure where:
1. **Recurrence** is the top-level concept.
2. **Frequency** and **Interval** define the pattern of recurrence.
3. **Start and End Conditions** constrain the recurrence.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The model assumes that:
- The scheduling system can accurately interpret and apply the recurrence parameters.
- The events or tasks being scheduled do not have conflicting requirements.

### 6.3 Invariants
The following properties must always hold true within the model:
- The recurrence pattern is consistent with the defined frequency and interval.
- The start and end conditions are respected in the generation of the event or task sequence.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

Document recurring, accepted patterns associated with this topic.

### Pattern A: Weekly Recurrence
- **Intent:** Schedule a task to occur every week on a specific day.
- **Context:** Useful for regular meetings, weekly reports, or maintenance tasks.
- **Tradeoffs:** Offers predictability but may not accommodate variable schedules or exceptions.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

Describe common but discouraged practices.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern A: Overly Complex Recurrence
- **Description:** Defining recurrence patterns that are overly complex or hard to understand.
- **Failure Mode:** Leads to errors in scheduling, misunderstandings among team members, or difficulties in maintaining the schedule.
- **Common Causes:** Attempting to accommodate too many exceptions or variables within a single recurrence pattern.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Explain unusual or ambiguous scenarios that may challenge the standard model.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.

- **Leap Year Handling:** How recurrence patterns should be adjusted to account for leap years, especially in monthly or yearly recurrences.
- **Time Zone Changes:** Managing recurrences across different time zones or during daylight saving time transitions.
