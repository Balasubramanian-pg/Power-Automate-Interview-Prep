# 32. Recurrence Trigger Mechanism

Canonical documentation for 32. Recurrence Trigger Mechanism. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The Recurrence Trigger Mechanism exists to address the need for automated, repetitive execution of tasks or processes within various systems, applications, and workflows. This class of problems involves managing recurring events, such as scheduled backups, periodic reports, or automated maintenance tasks. Misunderstanding or inconsistent application of recurrence trigger mechanisms can lead to errors, inefficiencies, or even system failures. For instance, incorrect configuration of recurrence patterns can result in missed executions, overlapping executions, or unintended resource utilization. The risks associated with poorly designed or implemented recurrence trigger mechanisms include data inconsistencies, performance degradation, and security vulnerabilities.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The Recurrence Trigger Mechanism conceptual model consists of three major components: the Trigger, the Scheduler, and the Executor. The Trigger is responsible for initiating the recurrence process, the Scheduler determines the timing and frequency of executions, and the Executor performs the actual task or process. These components interact to produce a predictable and reliable recurrence pattern, ensuring that tasks are executed as intended. The model is designed to produce outcomes such as automated task execution, reduced manual intervention, and improved system efficiency.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

**In scope:**
* Recurrence pattern definitions
* Trigger mechanisms
* Scheduling algorithms

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations (e.g., cron jobs, Windows Task Scheduler)
* Vendor-specific behavior (e.g., proprietary scheduling systems)
* Operational or procedural guidance (e.g., best practices for task automation)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Recurrence Pattern | A defined sequence of events or tasks that are executed at regular intervals |
| Trigger | An event or condition that initiates the recurrence process |
| Scheduler | A component responsible for determining the timing and frequency of executions |
| Executor | A component responsible for performing the actual task or process |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Recurrence Pattern
A recurrence pattern defines the sequence of events or tasks that are executed at regular intervals. This pattern can be based on various factors, such as time, date, or external events.

### 5.2 Trigger Mechanism
The trigger mechanism is responsible for initiating the recurrence process. This can be based on a schedule, an event, or a condition.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The recurrence pattern, trigger mechanism, and scheduler interact to produce a predictable and reliable recurrence pattern. The scheduler must ensure that the recurrence pattern is executed as defined, while the trigger mechanism must initiate the process at the correct time. Constraints, such as resource availability or dependencies, must be considered to ensure successful execution.

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for the Recurrence Trigger Mechanism consists of a trigger mechanism, a scheduler, and an executor. The trigger mechanism initiates the recurrence process, the scheduler determines the timing and frequency of executions, and the executor performs the actual task or process.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that the recurrence pattern is well-defined, the trigger mechanism is reliable, and the scheduler has access to necessary resources.

### 6.3 Invariants
The following properties must always hold true within the standard model:
* The recurrence pattern is executed as defined
* The trigger mechanism initiates the process at the correct time
* The scheduler ensures that the recurrence pattern is executed without conflicts or overlaps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern: Scheduled Task Automation
- **Intent:** Automate repetitive tasks to reduce manual intervention and improve efficiency
- **Context:** Suitable for tasks that require regular execution, such as backups or reports
- **Tradeoffs:** Reduced manual effort, improved consistency, and potential increased complexity

## 8. Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern: Overly Complex Recurrence Patterns
- **Description:** Recurrence patterns that are overly complex or difficult to maintain
- **Failure Mode:** Leads to errors, inconsistencies, or unintended behavior
- **Common Causes:** Poor design, inadequate testing, or insufficient documentation

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Edge cases, such as leap years or daylight saving time, can challenge the standard model. These scenarios require special consideration to ensure that the recurrence pattern is executed correctly.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.
