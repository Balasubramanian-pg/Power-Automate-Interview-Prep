# 19. Scenario Request New Software Flow

Canonical documentation for 19. Scenario Request New Software Flow. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The Scenario Request New Software Flow exists to address the complexities and inefficiencies that arise when organizations need to request, approve, and deploy new software applications. This process is crucial for maintaining a secure, efficient, and productive IT environment. However, it is often plagued by manual workflows, lack of standardization, and inadequate communication among stakeholders. The risks of misunderstanding or inconsistently applying this process include delayed software deployments, security vulnerabilities, and wasted resources. This documentation aims to provide a clear, standardized framework for managing the request new software flow, mitigating these risks and ensuring a streamlined, effective process.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of the Scenario Request New Software Flow involves several key components:
- **Request Initiation**: The process begins with a user or department requesting new software.
- **Approval Workflow**: The request is then routed through an approval process, which may involve multiple stakeholders and levels of approval.
- **Software Evaluation**: Once approved, the software is evaluated for compatibility, security, and compliance with organizational standards.
- **Deployment**: After evaluation, the software is deployed to the appropriate users or systems.
- **Post-Deployment Review**: Finally, the deployment is reviewed to ensure it meets the initial request and organizational needs.

These components are designed to work together to produce a seamless, efficient software request and deployment process that aligns with organizational goals and policies.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

The scope of this documentation includes:
* **Software Request Process**: The procedures and workflows associated with requesting new software.
* **Approval and Evaluation**: The standards and criteria used for approving and evaluating software requests.

Out of scope are:
* **Tool-specific implementations**: Details on how to use specific software or tools for managing the request process.
* **Vendor-specific behavior**: Information on how different vendors handle software requests and deployments.
* **Operational or procedural guidance**: Step-by-step instructions for daily operations or specific procedural tasks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Software Request | A formal ask for new software to be approved, evaluated, and deployed within an organization. |
| Approval Workflow | The process by which a software request is reviewed and approved by relevant stakeholders. |
| Software Evaluation | The assessment of software for compatibility, security, and compliance with organizational standards. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions are crafted to be timeless and applicable across various contexts, avoiding language that could become outdated or context-dependent.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Request Initiation
The request initiation phase involves a user or department identifying a need for new software and submitting a formal request. This request should include details about the software, its intended use, and the benefits it is expected to bring to the organization.

### 5.2 Approval Workflow
The approval workflow is a critical component that ensures software requests are properly vetted. It involves defining roles and responsibilities, establishing approval criteria, and outlining the workflow from initial request to final approval.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The request initiation and approval workflow are tightly coupled, with the approval workflow acting as a gatekeeper for all software requests. Constraints include ensuring that all requests are properly documented, that approvals are obtained from the appropriate stakeholders, and that the software aligns with organizational policies and standards.

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for the Scenario Request New Software Flow involves a linear progression from request initiation through approval, evaluation, deployment, and post-deployment review. Each stage is designed to ensure that the software meets organizational needs and standards.

### 6.2 Assumptions
This model assumes that:
- There is a clear, established process for requesting software.
- Stakeholders are aware of their roles and responsibilities within the approval workflow.
- Evaluation criteria for software are well-defined and aligned with organizational standards.

### 6.3 Invariants
Properties that must always hold true within this model include:
- All software requests must be formally submitted and approved.
- Software must be evaluated for security, compatibility, and compliance before deployment.
- Post-deployment reviews are conducted to ensure the software meets the initial request and organizational needs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern A: Automated Approval Workflow
- **Intent:** To streamline the approval process for routine software requests.
- **Context:** When the request is for widely used, low-risk software.
- **Tradeoffs:** Efficiency is gained, but there might be a slight increase in the risk of approving non-compliant software if not properly configured.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern A: Bypassing Approval
- **Description:** Ignoring or circumventing the established approval workflow for software requests.
- **Failure Mode:** This can lead to the deployment of non-compliant, insecure, or unnecessary software, posing significant risks to the organization.
- **Common Causes:** Urgency, lack of awareness of the approval process, or perceived inefficiencies in the current workflow.

> [!WARNING]
> Bypassing the approval process frequently leads to security, compliance, and operational issues.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Edge cases include situations where the software request does not fit neatly into the standard approval workflow, such as emergency requests for critical software patches or requests for open-source software that may not have a clear vendor support channel. These cases require careful consideration and potentially customized approval and evaluation processes.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and can be a common source of incorrect assumptions or overlooked vulnerabilities.
