# 26. Trigger Outputs for Selected Item

Canonical documentation for 26. Trigger Outputs for Selected Item. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The topic of Trigger Outputs for Selected Item exists to address the need for a standardized approach to handling outputs from triggers when a specific item is selected. This class of problems arises in various applications, including workflow management, event-driven systems, and user interface design. The risks or failures that arise when this topic is misunderstood or inconsistently applied include incorrect or unexpected behavior, data inconsistencies, and user frustration. Inconsistent application of trigger outputs can lead to bugs, errors, and security vulnerabilities, ultimately affecting the reliability and maintainability of systems.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model for Trigger Outputs for Selected Item consists of three major components: 
1. **Triggers**: These are events or actions that initiate the output process.
2. **Selected Items**: These are the specific items for which the trigger outputs are generated.
3. **Outputs**: These are the resulting actions, data, or notifications produced by the trigger.

These components relate to one another in the following way: when a trigger is activated, it checks if a specific item is selected. If the item is selected, the trigger generates the corresponding output. The outcome of this model is to produce consistent and predictable behavior in response to user interactions or system events.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

The scope of this documentation includes:
**In scope:**
* Conceptual models for trigger outputs
* Terminology and definitions related to selected items and triggers
* Standard usage patterns for trigger outputs

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations of trigger outputs
* Vendor-specific behavior for selected items
* Operational or procedural guidance for managing trigger outputs

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

The following terms are defined for use throughout this document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Trigger | An event or action that initiates a process or generates an output. |
| Selected Item | A specific item that has been chosen or highlighted for processing or output. |
| Output | The resulting action, data, or notification produced by a trigger. |
| Item Selection | The process of choosing or highlighting a specific item for processing or output. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Triggers
Triggers are the foundation of the Trigger Outputs for Selected Item model. They are the events or actions that initiate the output process. Triggers can be user-initiated, such as clicking a button, or system-initiated, such as a timer expiring.

### 5.2 Selected Items
Selected items are the specific items for which the trigger outputs are generated. These items can be chosen by the user or automatically selected by the system based on predefined criteria.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The core concepts interact in the following way: when a trigger is activated, it checks if a specific item is selected. If the item is selected, the trigger generates the corresponding output. The constraints on this interaction include:
- A trigger can only generate an output for a selected item.
- A selected item can have multiple triggers associated with it.
- The output generated by a trigger can depend on the specific item selected.

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for Trigger Outputs for Selected Item consists of the following steps:
1. Trigger activation: The trigger is activated by an event or action.
2. Item selection check: The system checks if a specific item is selected.
3. Output generation: If the item is selected, the trigger generates the corresponding output.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that:
- The trigger is properly configured and activated.
- The selected item is valid and exists in the system.
- The output generated by the trigger is consistent with the system's behavior.

### 6.3 Invariants
The following properties must always hold true in the standard model:
- A trigger can only generate an output for a selected item.
- The output generated by a trigger is consistent with the system's behavior.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern A: Single Trigger, Multiple Outputs
- **Intent:** To generate multiple outputs from a single trigger based on the selected item.
- **Context:** When a single trigger needs to produce different outputs for different selected items.
- **Tradeoffs:** This pattern provides flexibility in output generation but can increase complexity in trigger configuration.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern A: Hardcoded Trigger Outputs
- **Description:** Hardcoding trigger outputs for specific selected items.
- **Failure Mode:** This anti-pattern fails when the selected items or trigger outputs change, requiring significant updates to the hardcoded logic.
- **Common Causes:** This anti-pattern often arises from a lack of understanding of the standard model or an attempt to simplify trigger configuration.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Edge cases and boundary conditions for Trigger Outputs for Selected Item include:
- Handling multiple selected items with a single trigger.
- Generating outputs for items that are not selected.
- Dealing with triggers that have no associated selected items.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.
