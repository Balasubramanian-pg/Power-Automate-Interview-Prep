# 25. For a selected item SharePoint Trigger

Canonical documentation for 25. For a selected item SharePoint Trigger. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The "For a selected item" SharePoint Trigger exists to address the need for automating workflows and processes within SharePoint environments. It is designed to trigger actions or workflows when a specific item is selected, thereby streamlining tasks and improving productivity. The class of problems it addresses includes manual initiation of workflows, lack of automation in item-specific processes, and the need for real-time responses to item selections. Misunderstanding or inconsistent application of this trigger can lead to workflow inefficiencies, incorrect automation, and potential data inconsistencies.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of the "For a selected item" SharePoint Trigger involves several key components:
- **Trigger**: The mechanism that initiates the workflow or action based on the selection of an item.
- **Item**: The specific SharePoint item (e.g., list item, document) whose selection triggers the action.
- **Workflow/Action**: The automated process or set of tasks that are initiated by the trigger.
These components interact to produce outcomes such as automated email notifications, item updates, or the initiation of more complex workflows, all based on the selection of a specific item within SharePoint.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

Clarify the explicit boundaries of this documentation.

**In scope:**
* Conceptual model of the "For a selected item" trigger
* Terminology and definitions related to the trigger
* Core concepts and standard model for its application

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations of the trigger
* Vendor-specific behavior or customizations
* Operational or procedural guidance for setting up the trigger in various environments

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

Provide precise, stable definitions for all key terms used throughout this document.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Trigger | A mechanism that initiates a workflow or action based on a specific event or condition. |
| Item | A specific entity within SharePoint, such as a list item or document, whose selection can trigger an action. |
| Workflow | A series of automated tasks or processes that are initiated by a trigger. |
| Action | A single task or process that is part of a workflow or initiated by a trigger. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.

### 5.1 Trigger Mechanism
The trigger mechanism is the core component that detects the selection of an item and initiates the workflow or action. It is essential for automating processes based on item selection.

### 5.2 Item Selection
Item selection refers to the act of choosing a specific item within SharePoint, which then triggers the predefined workflow or action. This concept is crucial for understanding how the trigger operates.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The trigger mechanism and item selection interact to initiate workflows or actions. A key constraint is that the trigger must be properly configured to respond to the selection of the specific item, ensuring that the intended workflow or action is initiated correctly.

## 6. Standard Model

Describe the generally accepted or recommended model for this topic.

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for the "For a selected item" SharePoint Trigger involves configuring the trigger to monitor for item selections and then initiating the specified workflow or action upon detection of such an event. This model assumes a straightforward, automated process from item selection to workflow initiation.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The model assumes that:
- The SharePoint environment is properly set up and configured.
- The trigger is correctly configured to monitor the intended item.
- The workflow or action is defined and ready for initiation.

### 6.3 Invariants
The following properties must always hold true within the model:
- The trigger is initiated by the selection of a specific item.
- The workflow or action initiated is based on the configuration of the trigger.
- The process from item selection to workflow initiation is automated.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

Document recurring, accepted patterns associated with this topic.

### Pattern A: Automated Notification
- **Intent:** To notify stakeholders automatically when a specific item is selected.
- **Context:** Useful in scenarios where real-time notification is crucial, such as in project management or customer service applications.
- **Tradeoffs:** Provides immediate notification but may lead to information overload if not properly filtered.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

Describe common but discouraged practices.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern A: Overly Complex Triggers
- **Description:** Configuring triggers that are overly complex or nested, leading to difficulty in maintenance and debugging.
- **Failure Mode:** Such triggers may not initiate workflows correctly or may initiate them unnecessarily, causing inefficiencies.
- **Common Causes:** Lack of planning or understanding of the trigger's intended use case.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Explain unusual or ambiguous scenarios that may challenge the standard model.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.

- **Multiple Item Selection:** How the trigger behaves when multiple items are selected simultaneously.
- **Item Selection in Subfolders:** Whether the trigger monitors item selections within subfolders of the specified location.
