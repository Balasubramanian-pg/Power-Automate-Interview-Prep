# 30. Flashcard Accessing Selected Item Flows

Canonical documentation for 30. Flashcard Accessing Selected Item Flows. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The Flashcard Accessing Selected Item Flows topic exists to address the class of problems related to efficiently accessing and managing selected items within flashcard applications. The primary goal is to provide a standardized approach to handling user interactions, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience. Misunderstanding or inconsistent application of these flows can lead to usability issues, decreased user engagement, and increased development complexity. The risks associated with inadequate implementation include data inconsistencies, performance degradation, and negative user feedback.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of Flashcard Accessing Selected Item Flows consists of three major components:
- **User Interface (UI)**: The visual representation of the flashcard application, responsible for displaying items and handling user input.
- **Data Storage**: The repository of flashcard items, which can be a local database, file system, or remote server.
- **Business Logic**: The layer that manages the interaction between the UI and Data Storage, enforcing rules and constraints to ensure data consistency and integrity.

These components interact to produce the following outcomes:
- **Item Selection**: The user selects a flashcard item, triggering the application to retrieve and display the corresponding data.
- **Item Editing**: The user modifies a selected item, prompting the application to update the Data Storage and reflect the changes in the UI.
- **Item Navigation**: The user navigates through the flashcard deck, with the application managing the display of items and ensuring a smooth user experience.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

The scope of this documentation includes:
* **Flashcard Item Management**: The processes and rules governing the creation, editing, and deletion of flashcard items.
* **User Interaction Handling**: The mechanisms for capturing and responding to user input, such as selecting, editing, and navigating items.

Out of scope are:
* **Tool-specific implementations**: Details about specific programming languages, frameworks, or libraries used to implement flashcard applications.
* **Vendor-specific behavior**: Proprietary or customized features that deviate from the standard model.
* **Operational or procedural guidance**: Step-by-step instructions for developing, deploying, or maintaining flashcard applications.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

The following terms are used throughout this document:
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Flashcard Item | A single unit of content within a flashcard application, typically consisting of a question and answer pair. |
| Selected Item | The currently active or focused flashcard item, as determined by user input or application logic. |
| Data Storage | The repository of flashcard items, which can be a local database, file system, or remote server. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Flashcard Item
A flashcard item is the fundamental unit of content within a flashcard application. It typically consists of a question and answer pair, along with optional metadata such as tags, categories, or difficulty levels. The flashcard item is the core entity that the application manages and displays to the user.

### 5.2 Selected Item
The selected item is the currently active or focused flashcard item, as determined by user input or application logic. The selected item is used to display the corresponding data, handle user edits, and navigate through the flashcard deck.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The flashcard item and selected item concepts interact through the following relationships:
- A flashcard item can be selected by the user, triggering the application to display the corresponding data.
- A selected item can be edited by the user, prompting the application to update the Data Storage and reflect the changes in the UI.
- The application must ensure data consistency and integrity by enforcing rules and constraints, such as validating user input and preventing duplicate items.

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for Flashcard Accessing Selected Item Flows consists of the following components:
- **Flashcard Item Repository**: A centralized store of flashcard items, which can be a local database, file system, or remote server.
- **User Interface**: A visual representation of the flashcard application, responsible for displaying items and handling user input.
- **Business Logic**: A layer that manages the interaction between the UI and Flashcard Item Repository, enforcing rules and constraints to ensure data consistency and integrity.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes the following:
- The flashcard application has a centralized store of flashcard items.
- The user interface is responsible for displaying items and handling user input.
- The business logic layer is responsible for enforcing rules and constraints to ensure data consistency and integrity.

### 6.3 Invariants
The following properties must always hold true within the standard model:
- Each flashcard item has a unique identifier.
- The selected item is always a valid flashcard item.
- The application ensures data consistency and integrity by enforcing rules and constraints.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern A: Item Selection
- **Intent**: To select a flashcard item and display the corresponding data.
- **Context**: When the user interacts with the UI to select an item.
- **Tradeoffs**: The application must balance the need for efficient data retrieval with the need for a responsive user interface.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern A: Inconsistent Data Storage
- **Description**: Using multiple, inconsistent data storage mechanisms, leading to data inconsistencies and integrity issues.
- **Failure Mode**: The application fails to ensure data consistency and integrity, resulting in incorrect or missing data.
- **Common Causes**: Insufficient planning, inadequate testing, or lack of standardization.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

The following edge cases and boundary conditions may challenge the standard model:
- **Empty Flashcard Deck**: The application must handle the case where the flashcard deck is empty, providing a clear and intuitive user experience.
- **Duplicate Flashcard Items**: The application must prevent duplicate flashcard items, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.
