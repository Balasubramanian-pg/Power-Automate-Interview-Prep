# 20. Best Practices for Manual Trigger Inputs

Canonical documentation for 20. Best Practices for Manual Trigger Inputs. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The topic of manual trigger inputs exists to address the class of problems related to initiating automated processes or workflows through human intervention. Manual trigger inputs are crucial in scenarios where automated systems require external stimuli to execute specific tasks or transitions. The risks or failures that arise when manual trigger inputs are misunderstood or inconsistently applied include incorrect or delayed execution of processes, leading to inefficiencies, errors, or even system crashes. This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and implementing best practices for manual trigger inputs, thereby mitigating these risks and ensuring reliable and efficient operation of automated systems.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of manual trigger inputs revolves around the interaction between human operators and automated systems. The major conceptual components include:
- **Trigger Sources**: These are the interfaces or mechanisms through which human operators initiate the trigger, such as buttons, switches, or software interfaces.
- **Trigger Events**: These are the specific actions or conditions that occur when a trigger source is activated, such as a button press or a specific input value.
- **Trigger Handlers**: These are the components of the automated system that receive and process trigger events, determining the appropriate response or action.

These components relate to one another in a cause-and-effect chain, where the activation of a trigger source generates a trigger event, which is then processed by a trigger handler to produce a specific outcome. The model is designed to produce outcomes that are consistent, reliable, and aligned with the intended operation of the automated system.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

The scope of this documentation includes:
* **Design Principles**: Fundamental guidelines for designing manual trigger inputs that are intuitive, safe, and effective.
* **Implementation Best Practices**: Recommendations for implementing manual trigger inputs in a way that minimizes errors and ensures reliability.

Out of scope are:
* Tool-specific implementations: This documentation does not cover the specifics of how to implement manual trigger inputs using particular software tools or programming languages.
* Vendor-specific behavior: The focus is on general principles and best practices, not on the specific behaviors or requirements of particular vendors or products.
* Operational or procedural guidance: While this documentation touches on the operational aspects of manual trigger inputs, it does not provide detailed procedural guidance for specific scenarios or industries.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation, such as implementation guides or industry-specific standards.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Manual Trigger Input | A mechanism or interface through which a human operator initiates an action or process in an automated system. |
| Trigger Source | The physical or virtual interface that a human operator interacts with to initiate a trigger event. |
| Trigger Event | The specific action or condition that occurs when a trigger source is activated. |
| Trigger Handler | The component of an automated system that receives and processes trigger events. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions are crafted to be clear, unambiguous, and stable, avoiding contextual or time-bound language to ensure their validity as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Trigger Sources
Trigger sources are the entry points for human operators to interact with automated systems. They can be physical, such as buttons or switches, or virtual, such as software interfaces. The design of trigger sources is critical, as it directly affects the usability and safety of the system.

### 5.2 Trigger Events
Trigger events are the immediate consequences of activating a trigger source. They can range from simple actions, like turning a system on or off, to complex processes, such as initiating a sequence of automated tasks. Understanding trigger events is essential for designing and implementing effective manual trigger inputs.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The interaction between trigger sources, trigger events, and trigger handlers is governed by specific constraints and relationships. For example, a trigger source may only generate a trigger event under certain conditions, or a trigger handler may only process specific types of trigger events. These interactions and constraints are crucial for ensuring the correct and safe operation of automated systems.

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for manual trigger inputs involves a straightforward sequence: a human operator activates a trigger source, which generates a trigger event, and this event is then processed by a trigger handler to produce the desired outcome. This model emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and reliability in the design and implementation of manual trigger inputs.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that:
- Human operators are properly trained and aware of the functions and implications of the trigger sources they interact with.
- Trigger sources are designed and implemented to minimize errors and ensure safety.
- Trigger handlers are correctly configured to process trigger events appropriately.

### 6.3 Invariants
Properties that must always hold true within the standard model include:
- Consistency in the behavior of trigger sources and trigger handlers.
- Reliability in the processing of trigger events.
- Safety and security in the design and operation of manual trigger inputs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified to ensure that they do not compromise the safety, reliability, or efficiency of the automated system.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern A: Redundant Trigger Sources
- **Intent:** To ensure system availability and reliability by providing multiple means to initiate critical processes.
- **Context:** Applied in safety-critical or high-availability systems where a single point of failure could have significant consequences.
- **Tradeoffs:** Increased complexity and potential for operator error are balanced against improved system resilience.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern A: Insufficient Feedback
- **Description:** A trigger source that provides inadequate or no feedback to the operator after activation, leading to confusion or uncertainty about the system's state.
- **Failure Mode:** Operators may inadvertently initiate multiple trigger events or fail to recognize that a process has started, leading to errors or safety issues.
- **Common Causes:** Lack of consideration for user experience or oversight in the design phase.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues and should be avoided in the design and implementation of manual trigger inputs.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Edge cases include scenarios where the standard model may not apply directly, such as:
- **Multiple Concurrent Trigger Events:** How the system handles multiple trigger events occurring simultaneously or in rapid succession.
- **Trigger Source Failure:** Procedures for when a trigger source becomes inoperable or malfunctioning.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions. They require careful consideration to ensure the robustness and reliability of the system.
