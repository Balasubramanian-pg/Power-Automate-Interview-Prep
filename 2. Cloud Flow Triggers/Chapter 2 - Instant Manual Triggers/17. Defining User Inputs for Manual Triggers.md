# 17. Defining User Inputs for Manual Triggers

Canonical documentation for 17. Defining User Inputs for Manual Triggers. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

Defining user inputs for manual triggers is a critical aspect of workflow automation and process management. It addresses the class of problems related to initiating processes or workflows based on user actions or decisions. The lack of clear definitions for user inputs can lead to confusion, errors, and inefficiencies in process execution. Misunderstanding or inconsistent application of user input definitions can result in incorrect trigger activation, leading to process failures, data inconsistencies, or even security breaches. This documentation aims to provide a clear understanding of the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns for defining user inputs for manual triggers, thereby mitigating these risks.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model for defining user inputs for manual triggers consists of three major components: 
1. **Trigger Definition**: The specification of the conditions under which a trigger is activated.
2. **User Input**: The data or actions provided by the user that satisfy the trigger definition.
3. **Process Invocation**: The execution of a process or workflow in response to a trigger activation.

These components relate to one another in the following way: a user provides input that matches a trigger definition, which in turn invokes a process. The outcome of this model is the reliable and consistent execution of processes based on user actions, enhancing workflow automation and efficiency.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

Clarify the explicit boundaries of this documentation.

**In scope:**
* Conceptual models for user input definition
* Terminology and definitions related to manual triggers
* Standard usage patterns for defining user inputs

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations of manual triggers
* Vendor-specific behavior for workflow automation tools
* Operational or procedural guidance for managing workflows

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

Provide precise, stable definitions for all key terms used throughout this document.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Manual Trigger | A trigger that is activated by a user's explicit action or input. |
| User Input | Data or actions provided by a user that can activate a trigger. |
| Trigger Definition | The specification of conditions under which a trigger is activated. |
| Process Invocation | The execution of a process or workflow in response to a trigger activation. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.

### 5.1 Trigger Types
Trigger types refer to the different categories of triggers based on their activation mechanisms, such as manual, automated, or scheduled. Manual triggers are specifically activated by user inputs.

### 5.2 Input Validation
Input validation is the process of verifying that user inputs match the trigger definition. This ensures that triggers are activated only when the correct conditions are met.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
Trigger definitions, user inputs, and process invocations interact in a constrained manner. For instance, a trigger definition must specify the exact conditions under which a process is invoked, and user inputs must adhere to these conditions to activate the trigger successfully.

## 6. Standard Model

Describe the generally accepted or recommended model for this topic.

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for defining user inputs for manual triggers involves a clear and explicit trigger definition, robust input validation mechanisms, and a well-defined process invocation protocol. This model ensures that user inputs are correctly interpreted and that processes are invoked consistently and reliably.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that trigger definitions are unambiguous, user inputs are correctly formatted, and process invocations are properly configured.

### 6.3 Invariants
The invariants of the standard model include the consistency of trigger activation based on user inputs and the reliability of process invocation following trigger activation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

Document recurring, accepted patterns associated with this topic.

### Pattern: Input Validation
- **Intent:** Ensure that user inputs are valid and consistent with the trigger definition.
- **Context:** Applied during the trigger activation process.
- **Tradeoffs:** Adds complexity to the trigger activation mechanism but enhances reliability and security.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

Describe common but discouraged practices.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern: Loose Input Validation
- **Description:** Failing to implement robust input validation, leading to triggers being activated by incorrect or malicious inputs.
- **Failure Mode:** Triggers are activated inappropriately, leading to process failures or security breaches.
- **Common Causes:** Overlooking the importance of input validation or underestimating the complexity of user inputs.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Explain unusual or ambiguous scenarios that may challenge the standard model.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.

### Edge Case: Ambiguous Trigger Definitions
In scenarios where trigger definitions are ambiguous or open to interpretation, the standard model may not provide clear guidance on how to handle user inputs. This requires additional analysis and potentially custom solutions to ensure consistent trigger activation.
