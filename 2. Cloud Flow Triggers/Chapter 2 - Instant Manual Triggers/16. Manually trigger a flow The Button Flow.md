# 16. Manually trigger a flow The Button Flow

Canonical documentation for 16. Manually trigger a flow The Button Flow. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The ability to manually trigger a flow, particularly through a mechanism known as the Button Flow, addresses a critical need in workflow management and automation. It allows users to initiate processes or sequences of actions at will, which is essential for tasks that require human judgment, approval, or intervention. The class of problems it addresses includes the need for flexible workflow initiation, integration with human-centric processes, and the ability to handle exceptions or ad-hoc requests. Misunderstanding or inconsistent application of manual flow triggering can lead to inefficiencies, delays, or errors in workflow execution, ultimately affecting productivity and reliability.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of manually triggering a flow via the Button Flow involves several major components:
- **Trigger Mechanism:** The Button Flow acts as the trigger mechanism, allowing users to initiate a flow manually.
- **Workflow Definition:** The flow itself, which is defined by a series of steps or actions that are executed in a specific order.
- **User Interface:** The interface through which the user interacts with the Button Flow, such as a button click in a web application.
- **Workflow Engine:** The backend system that interprets the workflow definition and executes the flow upon being triggered.

These components relate to one another in that the user interacts with the user interface to trigger the flow, which is then executed by the workflow engine according to its definition. The outcome of this model is the flexible and controlled initiation of workflows, allowing for more dynamic and responsive business processes.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

Clarify the explicit boundaries of this documentation.

**In scope:**
* Conceptual model of manual flow triggering
* Button Flow as a trigger mechanism
* Integration with workflow engines and definitions

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations of the Button Flow
* Vendor-specific behavior of workflow engines
* Operational or procedural guidance for workflow management

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

Provide precise, stable definitions for all key terms used throughout this document.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Button Flow | A trigger mechanism that allows users to manually initiate a workflow or flow. |
| Workflow | A series of steps or actions that are executed in a specific order to achieve a particular goal. |
| Workflow Engine | A system that interprets and executes workflows based on their definitions. |
| Manual Trigger | The act of initiating a workflow through a deliberate user action, such as clicking a button. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.

### 5.1 Trigger Mechanism
The trigger mechanism, in this case, the Button Flow, is the core concept that enables manual flow triggering. It provides a straightforward way for users to initiate workflows, making it essential for integrating human-centric processes into automated workflows.

### 5.2 Workflow Definition
The workflow definition is another core concept, as it outlines the steps and actions that constitute the flow. This definition is crucial for the workflow engine to understand and execute the flow correctly upon being triggered.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The trigger mechanism interacts with the workflow definition through the workflow engine. The workflow engine must be able to interpret the workflow definition and execute it upon receiving the trigger from the Button Flow. A key constraint is that the workflow definition must be valid and properly configured for the workflow engine to execute it successfully.

## 6. Standard Model

Describe the generally accepted or recommended model for this topic.

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for manually triggering a flow via the Button Flow involves a user interacting with a user interface (e.g., clicking a button) that sends a trigger signal to the workflow engine. The workflow engine then executes the flow according to its predefined steps and actions.

### 6.2 Assumptions
This model assumes that the workflow definition is correctly configured, the workflow engine is operational, and the user has the necessary permissions to trigger the flow.

### 6.3 Invariants
Key invariants of this model include:
- The workflow engine must always be able to interpret and execute the workflow definition.
- The trigger mechanism (Button Flow) must always be able to send a valid trigger signal to the workflow engine.
- The user interface must always provide a clear and consistent way for users to trigger the flow.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

Document recurring, accepted patterns associated with this topic.

### Pattern A: Ad-Hoc Workflow Initiation
- **Intent:** To allow users to initiate workflows on an as-needed basis.
- **Context:** This pattern is typically applied in scenarios where workflows need to be started manually due to external factors or ad-hoc requests.
- **Tradeoffs:** This pattern provides flexibility but may introduce variability in workflow execution times and outcomes.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

Describe common but discouraged practices.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern A: Hard-Coded Triggers
- **Description:** Implementing trigger mechanisms that are tightly coupled to specific workflows or user interfaces.
- **Failure Mode:** This anti-pattern fails because it leads to inflexibility and makes it difficult to modify or extend workflows without significant rework.
- **Common Causes:** Teams may fall into this anti-pattern due to a lack of understanding of the importance of decoupling trigger mechanisms from specific workflows or due to time pressures that lead to expedient but not scalable solutions.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Explain unusual or ambiguous scenarios that may challenge the standard model.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.

- **Scenario:** A user attempts to trigger a flow that has been deprecated or is no longer supported.
- **Challenge:** The system must handle this scenario gracefully, potentially by notifying the user of the flow's status and providing alternatives or guidance.
