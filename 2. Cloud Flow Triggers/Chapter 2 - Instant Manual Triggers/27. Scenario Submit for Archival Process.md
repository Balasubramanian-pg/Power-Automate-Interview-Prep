# 27. Scenario Submit for Archival Process

Canonical documentation for 27. Scenario Submit for Archival Process. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The Scenario Submit for Archival Process exists to address the need for a standardized and efficient method of submitting scenarios for archival purposes. This process is crucial in various fields, including data management, compliance, and research, where scenarios must be preserved for future reference or analysis. The class of problems it addresses includes data loss, inconsistencies in archival processes, and the inability to retrieve or analyze archived scenarios. Misunderstanding or inconsistent application of this process can lead to significant risks, including non-compliance with regulatory requirements, data integrity issues, and the inability to support business continuity.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of the Scenario Submit for Archival Process involves several major components:
- **Scenario Identification**: The process of recognizing and categorizing scenarios that need to be archived.
- **Data Preparation**: Ensuring that the scenario data is in a suitable format for archival.
- **Submission**: The act of transferring the prepared scenario data to the archival system.
- **Validation**: Verifying that the submitted scenario is correctly archived and accessible.

These components relate to one another in a sequential manner, with each step building upon the previous one to ensure that scenarios are properly identified, prepared, submitted, and validated for archival. The outcome of this model is to produce a reliable, accessible, and compliant archival process for scenarios.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

The explicit boundaries of this documentation are as follows:

**In scope:**
* Conceptual models for scenario submission
* Terminology and definitions related to archival processes
* Standard usage patterns for submitting scenarios for archival

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations of archival systems
* Vendor-specific behavior or configurations
* Operational or procedural guidance for managing archived scenarios

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

The following terms are defined for clarity and consistency throughout this document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Scenario | A set of conditions or events that are documented for analysis or reference. |
| Archival Process | The method by which scenarios are prepared, submitted, and stored for long-term preservation. |
| Data Integrity | The accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the data within the archived scenario. |
| Compliance | Adherence to regulatory or organizational standards for data management and archival. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions are crafted to be timeless and applicable across various contexts, avoiding language that could become outdated or context-dependent.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Scenario Identification
Scenario identification is the initial step in the archival process, involving the recognition and categorization of scenarios that are candidates for archival. This process is critical for ensuring that relevant scenarios are not overlooked and that only appropriate scenarios are archived.

### 5.2 Data Preparation
Data preparation involves formatting and structuring the scenario data in a way that is compatible with the archival system. This may include data cleansing, normalization, and transformation to ensure that the data is accurate, complete, and consistent.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The core concepts of scenario identification, data preparation, submission, and validation interact in a linear sequence. Each step has dependencies on the previous one, with scenario identification influencing data preparation, which in turn affects the submission and validation processes. Constraints include data format requirements, archival system capacity, and regulatory compliance standards.

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for the Scenario Submit for Archival Process involves a structured approach:
1. Identify the scenario to be archived.
2. Prepare the scenario data according to archival system requirements.
3. Submit the prepared data to the archival system.
4. Validate the submission to ensure data integrity and accessibility.

### 6.2 Assumptions
This model assumes that:
- The archival system is properly configured and maintained.
- Scenario data can be prepared in a format compatible with the archival system.
- Regulatory and organizational compliance standards are well-defined and accessible.

### 6.3 Invariants
Properties that must always hold true within this model include:
- Data integrity is maintained throughout the archival process.
- Compliance with regulatory and organizational standards is ensured.
- The archival process is documented and traceable.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified to ensure compliance and data integrity.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern A: Automated Data Preparation
- **Intent:** To streamline the data preparation step by automating tasks such as data cleansing and formatting.
- **Context:** When dealing with large volumes of scenario data or when data preparation is repetitive.
- **Tradeoffs:** Automation may require significant upfront investment in tools and training but can significantly reduce manual effort and increase consistency in the long run.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern A: Manual Archival Without Validation
- **Description:** Manually submitting scenarios for archival without validating the submission.
- **Failure Mode:** This can lead to scenarios being archived incorrectly or not at all, resulting in data loss or non-compliance.
- **Common Causes:** Lack of understanding of the importance of validation, insufficient resources, or reliance on manual processes without adequate checks.

> [!WARNING]
> This anti-pattern can lead to significant issues with data integrity and compliance.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Edge cases include scenarios with unique or complex data formats that challenge the standard archival process. Boundary conditions may involve scenarios that are at the limits of what the archival system can handle, such as very large datasets or scenarios with specific legal or regulatory requirements.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases and boundary conditions require careful consideration to ensure that the archival process remains robust and compliant.
