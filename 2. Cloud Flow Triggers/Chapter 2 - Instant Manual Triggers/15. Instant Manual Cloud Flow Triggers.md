# 15. Instant Manual Cloud Flow Triggers

Canonical documentation for 15. Instant Manual Cloud Flow Triggers. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

Instant Manual Cloud Flow Triggers exist to address the need for on-demand execution of cloud-based workflows, enabling users to manually initiate flows as required. This topic addresses the class of problems related to ad-hoc workflow execution, where traditional automated triggers may not be sufficient or practical. The risks or failures that arise when this topic is misunderstood or inconsistently applied include incorrect or incomplete workflow execution, data inconsistencies, and potential security vulnerabilities due to unauthorized access or misuse of triggers.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of Instant Manual Cloud Flow Triggers consists of three major components:
- **Trigger**: The mechanism that initiates the flow execution.
- **Flow**: The sequence of tasks or activities that are executed in response to the trigger.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: The underlying platform that hosts the flows and provides the necessary resources for execution.

These components relate to one another in the following way: the trigger is used to initiate the flow, which is then executed on the cloud infrastructure. The outcome of this model is to provide a flexible and controlled way to execute workflows on-demand, ensuring that the flows are executed correctly and securely.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

Clarify the explicit boundaries of this documentation.

**In scope:**
* Conceptual model of Instant Manual Cloud Flow Triggers
* Terminology and definitions related to triggers and flows
* Standard usage patterns and best practices

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations of cloud flow triggers
* Vendor-specific behavior or configurations
* Operational or procedural guidance for managing cloud flows

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

Provide precise, stable definitions for all key terms used throughout this document.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Trigger | A mechanism that initiates the execution of a flow. |
| Flow | A sequence of tasks or activities that are executed in response to a trigger. |
| Cloud Infrastructure | The underlying platform that hosts the flows and provides the necessary resources for execution. |
| Manual Trigger | A trigger that is initiated by a user or external system, as opposed to an automated trigger. |
| Instant Trigger | A trigger that executes immediately, without delay or scheduling. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.

### 5.1 Trigger
A trigger is the mechanism that initiates the execution of a flow. In the context of Instant Manual Cloud Flow Triggers, a trigger is typically a manual trigger, initiated by a user or external system.

### 5.2 Flow
A flow is the sequence of tasks or activities that are executed in response to a trigger. Flows can be composed of various tasks, such as data processing, API calls, or notifications.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The trigger and flow interact in the following way: the trigger initiates the execution of the flow, which is then executed on the cloud infrastructure. The constraints on this interaction include:
* The trigger must be valid and authorized to initiate the flow.
* The flow must be properly configured and validated to ensure correct execution.
* The cloud infrastructure must provide the necessary resources and security controls to support the execution of the flow.

## 6. Standard Model

Describe the generally accepted or recommended model for this topic.

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for Instant Manual Cloud Flow Triggers consists of the following components:
* A trigger mechanism that initiates the execution of a flow.
* A flow definition that specifies the sequence of tasks or activities to be executed.
* A cloud infrastructure that hosts the flows and provides the necessary resources for execution.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that:
* The trigger is initiated by a authorized user or external system.
* The flow is properly configured and validated to ensure correct execution.
* The cloud infrastructure provides the necessary resources and security controls to support the execution of the flow.

### 6.3 Invariants
The invariants of the standard model include:
* The trigger must always initiate the execution of a valid flow.
* The flow must always be executed on a secure and authorized cloud infrastructure.
* The execution of the flow must always be auditable and trackable.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

Document recurring, accepted patterns associated with this topic.

### Pattern A: Scheduled Trigger
- **Intent:** Execute a flow at a scheduled time or interval.
- **Context:** When a flow needs to be executed on a regular basis, such as daily or weekly.
- **Tradeoffs:** Provides predictability and consistency, but may not be suitable for ad-hoc or on-demand execution.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

Describe common but discouraged practices.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern A: Hardcoded Triggers
- **Description:** Using hardcoded triggers that are not flexible or configurable.
- **Failure Mode:** Leads to inflexibility and difficulty in maintaining or updating the triggers.
- **Common Causes:** Lack of understanding of the importance of flexible and configurable triggers.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Explain unusual or ambiguous scenarios that may challenge the standard model.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.

* What happens when a trigger is initiated by an unauthorized user or system?
* How does the standard model handle errors or exceptions during flow execution?
* What are the implications of executing a flow on a cloud infrastructure with limited resources or security controls?
