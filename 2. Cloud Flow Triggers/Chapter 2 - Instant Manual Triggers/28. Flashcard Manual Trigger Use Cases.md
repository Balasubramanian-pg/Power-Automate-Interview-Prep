# 28. Flashcard Manual Trigger Use Cases

Canonical documentation for 28. Flashcard Manual Trigger Use Cases. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The Flashcard Manual Trigger Use Cases topic exists to address the need for a structured approach to creating and utilizing flashcards in educational and learning environments. The class of problems it addresses includes the inconsistent application of flashcard triggers, leading to ineffective learning outcomes and decreased user engagement. The risks or failures that arise when it is misunderstood or inconsistently applied include reduced knowledge retention, decreased motivation, and inefficient use of study time.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of Flashcard Manual Trigger Use Cases consists of three major components: 
1. **Flashcard Creation**: The process of designing and developing flashcards with relevant questions and answers.
2. **Trigger Mechanisms**: The methods used to initiate the display of flashcards, such as manual triggers, automated schedules, or event-based triggers.
3. **Learning Outcomes**: The desired results of using flashcards, including improved knowledge retention, increased understanding, and enhanced recall.

These components relate to one another in that the creation of effective flashcards is dependent on the selection of appropriate trigger mechanisms, which in turn impact the learning outcomes. The model is designed to produce improved learning outcomes by providing a structured approach to flashcard creation and utilization.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

**In scope:**
* Flashcard design principles
* Manual trigger mechanisms
* Learning outcome assessment

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations (e.g., Anki, Quizlet)
* Vendor-specific behavior (e.g., proprietary algorithms)
* Operational or procedural guidance (e.g., study schedules, classroom management)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Flashcard | A card with a question or prompt on one side and the answer or response on the other. |
| Manual Trigger | A trigger mechanism that requires user intervention to initiate the display of a flashcard. |
| Learning Outcome | The desired result of using flashcards, including improved knowledge retention, increased understanding, and enhanced recall. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Flashcard Creation
Flashcard creation involves designing and developing flashcards with relevant questions and answers. This process requires careful consideration of the learning objectives, the level of difficulty, and the clarity of the questions and answers.

### 5.2 Trigger Mechanisms
Trigger mechanisms are the methods used to initiate the display of flashcards. Manual triggers, such as clicking a button or typing a command, are a common type of trigger mechanism. Automated schedules and event-based triggers are other examples of trigger mechanisms.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The core concepts interact in that the creation of effective flashcards is dependent on the selection of appropriate trigger mechanisms, which in turn impact the learning outcomes. For example, a manual trigger mechanism may be more effective for certain types of learning objectives, while an automated schedule may be more suitable for others. The constraints of flashcard creation, such as the need for clear and concise questions and answers, must be balanced with the constraints of trigger mechanisms, such as the need for timely and relevant initiation of flashcard display.

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for Flashcard Manual Trigger Use Cases involves the creation of flashcards with relevant questions and answers, the selection of a manual trigger mechanism, and the initiation of flashcard display through user intervention. The model assumes that the user has a clear understanding of the learning objectives and the level of difficulty required.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that:
* The user has a clear understanding of the learning objectives and the level of difficulty required.
* The flashcards are designed with relevant questions and answers.
* The manual trigger mechanism is selected based on the learning objectives and the level of difficulty.

### 6.3 Invariants
The standard model has the following invariants:
* The flashcards must be designed with clear and concise questions and answers.
* The manual trigger mechanism must be initiated through user intervention.
* The learning outcomes must be assessed and evaluated regularly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern A: Spaced Repetition
- **Intent:** To improve knowledge retention and recall by reviewing flashcards at increasingly longer intervals.
- **Context:** When the user wants to reinforce previously learned material and prevent forgetting.
- **Tradeoffs:** The user must balance the need for review with the need for new learning, and the intervals between reviews must be adjusted based on the user's performance.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern A: Over-Reliance on Flashcards
- **Description:** Relying too heavily on flashcards as the sole means of learning, without supplementing with other study materials or techniques.
- **Failure Mode:** The user may not develop a deep understanding of the material and may struggle to apply it in different contexts.
- **Common Causes:** The user may be tempted to rely solely on flashcards due to their convenience and ease of use, without recognizing the limitations of this approach.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Edge cases and boundary conditions may arise when the user is unsure of how to design effective flashcards or select the most appropriate trigger mechanism. For example, the user may need to balance the level of difficulty with the need for review, or adjust the intervals between reviews based on their performance. These edge cases and boundary conditions require careful consideration and may require deviations from the standard model.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.
