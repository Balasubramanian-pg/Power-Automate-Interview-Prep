# 66. Dataverse Scope User Business Unit Org

Canonical documentation for 66. Dataverse Scope User Business Unit Org. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The Dataverse Scope User Business Unit Org topic exists to address the complexities of managing data access and security within organizations that utilize Dataverse, a data integration and management platform. The class of problems it addresses includes data governance, access control, and data security. Misunderstanding or inconsistent application of these concepts can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and non-compliance with regulatory requirements. The risks associated with these failures include financial losses, reputational damage, and legal liabilities.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of Dataverse Scope User Business Unit Org consists of three major components: Dataverse, User, and Business Unit Org. Dataverse represents the data integration and management platform, User represents the individuals or entities accessing the data, and Business Unit Org represents the organizational structure and hierarchy. These components relate to one another through access control and data governance policies, which dictate how users can interact with the data within the Dataverse. The outcomes of this model are designed to produce a secure, compliant, and well-governed data management system.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

**In scope:**
* Dataverse configuration and management
* User access control and authentication
* Business Unit Org structure and hierarchy

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations (e.g., Power Apps, Power Automate)
* Vendor-specific behavior (e.g., Microsoft, Salesforce)
* Operational or procedural guidance (e.g., data backup, disaster recovery)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Dataverse | A data integration and management platform |
| User | An individual or entity accessing the data within the Dataverse |
| Business Unit Org | The organizational structure and hierarchy of the organization |
| Access Control | The process of granting or denying access to data within the Dataverse |
| Data Governance | The set of policies and procedures for managing data within the Dataverse |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Dataverse
Dataverse is the central component of the conceptual model, representing the data integration and management platform. It provides a unified view of the data and enables users to access and interact with the data in a secure and governed manner.

### 5.2 User
The User concept represents the individuals or entities accessing the data within the Dataverse. Users can have different roles and permissions, which dictate their level of access to the data.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The core concepts interact through access control and data governance policies. For example, a user's role and permissions determine their level of access to the data within the Dataverse, and the Business Unit Org structure and hierarchy influence the access control and data governance policies.

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for Dataverse Scope User Business Unit Org consists of a hierarchical structure, with the Business Unit Org at the top, followed by the Dataverse, and then the Users. Access control and data governance policies are applied at each level of the hierarchy, ensuring that users can only access the data they are authorized to access.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that the organization has a well-defined Business Unit Org structure and hierarchy, and that the Dataverse is properly configured and managed.

### 6.3 Invariants
The following properties must always hold true within the standard model:
* Users can only access data within the Dataverse for which they have been granted permission.
* Access control and data governance policies are applied consistently throughout the hierarchy.
* The Business Unit Org structure and hierarchy are well-defined and up-to-date.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern A: Role-Based Access Control
- **Intent:** To grant users access to data within the Dataverse based on their role within the organization.
- **Context:** When the organization has a well-defined Business Unit Org structure and hierarchy.
- **Tradeoffs:** Provides a high level of security and governance, but can be complex to implement and manage.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern A: Overly Permissive Access Control
- **Description:** Granting users excessive access to data within the Dataverse, without proper justification or governance.
- **Failure Mode:** Leads to data breaches and unauthorized access.
- **Common Causes:** Lack of understanding of access control and data governance principles, or inadequate training and support.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

One edge case is when a user has multiple roles within the organization, and their access to data within the Dataverse needs to be determined based on their multiple roles. Another edge case is when the Business Unit Org structure and hierarchy are not well-defined or are in a state of flux, making it challenging to apply access control and data governance policies consistently.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.
