# 72. Child Flow Triggers

Canonical documentation for 72. Child Flow Triggers. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

Child Flow Triggers address the need for managing complex workflows and business processes by enabling the creation of nested workflows, where a parent workflow can trigger the execution of one or more child workflows. This capability is crucial in scenarios where a high-level process needs to be broken down into smaller, manageable tasks, each potentially requiring its own workflow. The class of problems it addresses includes workflow complexity, scalability, and maintainability. Misunderstanding or inconsistent application of Child Flow Triggers can lead to workflow deadlocks, inefficiencies, and difficulties in tracking and managing workflow states.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of Child Flow Triggers involves several key components:
- **Parent Workflow**: The high-level workflow that initiates the execution of child workflows.
- **Child Workflow**: The workflows triggered by the parent workflow, each representing a subset of the overall business process.
- **Trigger Mechanism**: The mechanism by which the parent workflow initiates the child workflows, which can be based on various conditions or events.
- **Workflow State Management**: The system responsible for managing the states of both parent and child workflows, ensuring consistency and integrity across the workflow hierarchy.

These components interact to produce outcomes such as efficient workflow execution, improved scalability, and enhanced manageability of complex business processes.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

Clarify the explicit boundaries of this documentation.

**In scope:**
* Conceptual model of Child Flow Triggers
* Terminology and definitions related to Child Flow Triggers
* Standard usage patterns and best practices

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations of Child Flow Triggers
* Vendor-specific behavior or customizations
* Operational or procedural guidance for workflow management

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

Provide precise, stable definitions for all key terms used throughout this document.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Parent Workflow | A high-level workflow that can trigger the execution of one or more child workflows. |
| Child Workflow | A workflow triggered by a parent workflow, representing a subset of the overall business process. |
| Trigger Mechanism | The method or condition by which a parent workflow initiates a child workflow. |
| Workflow State | The current status or condition of a workflow, which can include states such as "initiated," "in progress," "completed," or "failed." |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.

### 5.1 Parent Workflow
The parent workflow is the primary workflow that oversees the execution of child workflows. It is responsible for initiating child workflows based on predefined conditions or events.

### 5.2 Child Workflow
Child workflows are subordinate to the parent workflow and are executed as part of the overall business process. Each child workflow can have its own set of tasks, conditions, and outcomes.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The parent and child workflows interact through the trigger mechanism, which can be based on various conditions such as completion of tasks, achievement of milestones, or occurrence of specific events. Constraints include ensuring that child workflows do not execute independently of the parent workflow and that the workflow state management system maintains consistency across all workflows.

## 6. Standard Model

Describe the generally accepted or recommended model for this topic.

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for Child Flow Triggers involves a hierarchical structure where a parent workflow can trigger multiple child workflows. Each child workflow operates within the context of the parent workflow, and their execution is managed by the workflow state management system.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The model assumes that the workflow management system supports hierarchical workflows, that trigger mechanisms are well-defined and consistent, and that workflow state management is robust and reliable.

### 6.3 Invariants
The model invariants include:
- A child workflow cannot execute without being triggered by a parent workflow.
- The state of a child workflow must always be consistent with the state of its parent workflow.
- The workflow state management system must ensure that all workflows (parent and child) are in a valid state at all times.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

Document recurring, accepted patterns associated with this topic.

### Pattern A: Sequential Child Workflows
- **Intent:** To execute a series of child workflows in a specific order, where each child workflow starts after the previous one completes.
- **Context:** When the business process requires a linear progression of tasks.
- **Tradeoffs:** Ensures sequential execution but may introduce delays if one child workflow fails or is delayed.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

Describe common but discouraged practices.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern A: Unmanaged Child Workflows
- **Description:** Allowing child workflows to execute without proper management or oversight.
- **Failure Mode:** Can lead to workflow deadlocks, inconsistencies, or uncontrolled proliferation of workflows.
- **Common Causes:** Lack of understanding of workflow management principles or inadequate implementation of workflow state management.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Explain unusual or ambiguous scenarios that may challenge the standard model.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.

### Edge Case: Recursive Child Workflows
In scenarios where a child workflow can potentially trigger another instance of itself (either directly or indirectly), special care must be taken to avoid infinite recursion and to ensure that the workflow state management system can handle such complexity.
