# 79. Exporting and Importing Flows with Triggers

Canonical documentation for 79. Exporting and Importing Flows with Triggers. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The ability to export and import flows with triggers is crucial in workflow management systems, as it enables the reuse, sharing, and migration of complex workflows across different environments or platforms. This topic addresses the class of problems related to workflow portability, reusability, and scalability. Misunderstanding or inconsistent application of export and import mechanisms can lead to errors, data loss, or workflow corruption, resulting in significant productivity losses and system downtime. The risks include version incompatibilities, trigger mismatches, and dependency issues, which can compromise the integrity and reliability of the workflows.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of exporting and importing flows with triggers involves several key components:
- **Workflows**: These are the sequences of tasks or activities that are automated or managed within a system.
- **Triggers**: These are the events or conditions that initiate the execution of a workflow or a part of it.
- **Export Mechanism**: This is the process or tool used to extract workflows with their associated triggers from one system or environment.
- **Import Mechanism**: This is the process or tool used to integrate exported workflows with triggers into another system or environment.
The model is designed to produce outcomes such as workflow portability, reusability, and efficient migration, ensuring that workflows can be easily moved or shared without compromising their functionality or integrity.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

Clarify the explicit boundaries of this documentation.

**In scope:**
* Conceptual models of workflow export and import
* Trigger handling and compatibility
* Best practices for workflow migration and reuse

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations of export and import features
* Vendor-specific behavior or proprietary formats
* Operational or procedural guidance for specific workflow management systems

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

Provide precise, stable definitions for all key terms used throughout this document.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Workflow | A series of tasks or activities automated or managed within a system. |
| Trigger | An event or condition that initiates the execution of a workflow or part of it. |
| Export | The process of extracting workflows with their associated triggers from a system. |
| Import | The process of integrating exported workflows with triggers into another system. |
| Portability | The ability of a workflow to be moved or shared across different environments without compromising its functionality. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.

### 5.1 Workflow Structure
A high-level explanation of how workflows are composed, including tasks, decisions, and actions, and how triggers are integrated into this structure.

### 5.2 Trigger Types
Explanation of different types of triggers (e.g., time-based, event-based, manual) and their roles in initiating workflow execution.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
Description of how workflows and triggers interact, including required relationships (e.g., a workflow must have at least one trigger) and constraints (e.g., trigger compatibility across different systems).

## 6. Standard Model

Describe the generally accepted or recommended model for this topic.

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for exporting and importing flows with triggers involves a structured approach to workflow extraction and integration, ensuring that all relevant components, including triggers, are properly handled and preserved.

### 6.2 Assumptions
Assumptions under which the model is valid include the existence of compatible workflow management systems, standardized trigger formats, and adequate export/import mechanisms.

### 6.3 Invariants
Properties that must always hold true within the model include the preservation of workflow integrity, trigger functionality, and compatibility across different environments.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

Document recurring, accepted patterns associated with this topic.

### Pattern A: Workflow Template
- **Intent:** To create reusable workflow templates that can be easily exported and imported across different projects or environments.
- **Context:** When workflows have common structures or triggers that can be standardized.
- **Tradeoffs:** Balancing the effort to create and maintain templates against the benefits of workflow reuse and efficiency.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

Describe common but discouraged practices.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern A: Hard-Coded Triggers
- **Description:** Using triggers that are hard-coded to specific environments or systems, making workflows non-portable.
- **Failure Mode:** Workflows fail to execute properly when imported into a different environment.
- **Common Causes:** Lack of planning for workflow portability, insufficient understanding of trigger compatibility.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Explain unusual or ambiguous scenarios that may challenge the standard model.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.

Examples include workflows with complex, nested triggers or those that rely on environment-specific variables or conditions.
