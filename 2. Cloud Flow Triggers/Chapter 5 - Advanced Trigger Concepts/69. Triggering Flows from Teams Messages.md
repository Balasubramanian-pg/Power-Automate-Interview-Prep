# 69. Triggering Flows from Teams Messages

Canonical documentation for 69. Triggering Flows from Teams Messages. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The ability to trigger flows from Teams messages addresses the class of problems related to automating workflows and integrating Microsoft Teams with other applications and services. This capability enables users to streamline their work processes, reduce manual effort, and increase productivity. However, when misunderstood or inconsistently applied, it can lead to errors, inefficiencies, and security risks. The primary risks include incorrect flow triggers, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and disruptions to critical business processes.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model for triggering flows from Teams messages consists of three major components: 
1. **Microsoft Teams**: The communication and collaboration platform where messages are sent and received.
2. **Flow Triggers**: The mechanisms that initiate the execution of a flow based on specific conditions or events, such as the receipt of a message in Teams.
3. **Workflows (Flows)**: The automated processes that are triggered by flow triggers, which can interact with various applications and services to perform tasks, manipulate data, and send notifications.

These components relate to one another in the following way: when a message is sent in Teams, it can trigger a flow if the message meets the conditions defined in the flow trigger. The triggered flow then executes a series of actions, which can include interacting with other applications, services, or Teams itself.

The outcome of this model is to automate workflows, enhance collaboration, and increase productivity by integrating Teams with other tools and services, thereby reducing manual effort and minimizing the risk of human error.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

The scope of this documentation includes:
* **Flow Triggers**: The definition, configuration, and best practices for triggers that initiate flows from Teams messages.
* **Workflow Integration**: The integration of flows with Microsoft Teams and other applications or services.

Out of scope are:
* **Tool-specific implementations**: Detailed instructions for specific flow or integration tools.
* **Vendor-specific behavior**: Documentation of proprietary features or behaviors of particular vendors' products.
* **Operational or procedural guidance**: Step-by-step guides for operational tasks or procedures related to flow management.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Flow | A series of automated actions that can be triggered by specific events or conditions. |
| Trigger | A condition or event that initiates the execution of a flow. |
| Action | A single step within a flow that performs a specific task. |
| Connector | A component that enables interaction between a flow and an external application or service. |
| Microsoft Teams | A communication and collaboration platform that integrates with flows. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Flow Triggers
Flow triggers are the core mechanism by which flows are initiated from Teams messages. They define the conditions under which a flow should start, such as the receipt of a specific message or the mention of a particular keyword.

### 5.2 Workflow Actions
Workflow actions are the individual steps that a flow executes. These can range from simple tasks like sending a notification to complex operations like creating a new item in a database or triggering another flow.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
Flow triggers and workflow actions interact through the flow's logic, which defines the sequence and conditions under which actions are executed. Constraints include the availability of connectors for integrating with external applications, the permissions required to access data, and the limitations imposed by the flow trigger conditions.

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for triggering flows from Teams messages involves defining a flow trigger that listens for specific conditions within Teams (e.g., a new message in a channel) and then executes a series of workflow actions based on that trigger. The model assumes the use of connectors to integrate with external applications and services.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The model assumes that:
- The user has the necessary permissions to create and manage flows.
- The required connectors for integrating with external applications are available and properly configured.
- The flow trigger conditions are correctly defined to avoid false positives or negatives.

### 6.3 Invariants
The invariants of the model include:
- A flow can only be triggered by a valid trigger condition.
- Each flow execution is a separate instance, with its own context and state.
- The flow's actions are executed in the order defined by the flow's logic.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern: Automated Notification
- **Intent**: Automate the process of notifying team members or stakeholders about specific events or updates.
- **Context**: When there is a need to keep teams informed about changes, updates, or new information.
- **Tradeoffs**: Automates notification process, reducing manual effort, but may lead to information overload if not properly filtered.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern: Overly Complex Triggers
- **Description**: Defining flow triggers that are too complex or nuanced, leading to difficulties in maintenance and debugging.
- **Failure Mode**: The trigger fails to initiate the flow as expected, or it initiates the flow incorrectly, leading to errors or unnecessary executions.
- **Common Causes**: Lack of clear requirements, insufficient testing, or over-engineering of the trigger conditions.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Edge cases include scenarios where the flow trigger conditions are ambiguous or where the flow actions encounter unexpected data or states. Examples include:
- A message that partially matches the trigger condition but does not fully qualify.
- A flow action that attempts to access data that is currently unavailable or restricted.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.
