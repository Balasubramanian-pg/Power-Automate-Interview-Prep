# 61. Automated Trigger Run Duration Limits

Canonical documentation for 61. Automated Trigger Run Duration Limits. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The topic of Automated Trigger Run Duration Limits exists to address the class of problems related to the uncontrolled execution of automated triggers in various systems, which can lead to performance degradation, resource waste, and potential security vulnerabilities. The risks or failures that arise when this topic is misunderstood or inconsistently applied include prolonged system downtime, data corruption, and financial losses due to inefficient resource utilization. This section is descriptive, not instructional, and aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the problem space.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of Automated Trigger Run Duration Limits consists of three major components: 
1. **Trigger**: An automated mechanism that initiates a specific action or set of actions in response to a predefined event or condition.
2. **Run Duration**: The amount of time a trigger is allowed to execute before it is terminated or interrupted.
3. **Limit**: A predefined constraint that restricts the run duration of a trigger to prevent excessive resource utilization or other negative consequences.

These components relate to one another in that a trigger is assigned a run duration limit, which determines how long the trigger can execute before it is terminated. The outcome of this model is designed to produce a balanced and efficient system that minimizes the risk of trigger-related issues while still allowing for the effective execution of automated tasks.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

The scope of this documentation includes:
* **Trigger Configuration**: The process of defining and assigning run duration limits to automated triggers.
* **Trigger Monitoring**: The process of tracking and managing trigger execution to ensure compliance with assigned run duration limits.

Out of scope are:
* Tool-specific implementations: This documentation does not address the specific implementation details of automated trigger run duration limits in various tools or systems.
* Vendor-specific behavior: The behavior of automated triggers and their run duration limits may vary between vendors, and this documentation does not attempt to standardize or dictate vendor-specific behavior.
* Operational or procedural guidance: This documentation does not provide operational or procedural guidance on how to manage or troubleshoot automated triggers in specific environments.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

The following terms are used throughout this document:
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Trigger | An automated mechanism that initiates a specific action or set of actions in response to a predefined event or condition. |
| Run Duration | The amount of time a trigger is allowed to execute before it is terminated or interrupted. |
| Limit | A predefined constraint that restricts the run duration of a trigger to prevent excessive resource utilization or other negative consequences. |
| Timeout | A specific type of limit that terminates a trigger's execution after a predefined period of inactivity. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Trigger Configuration
Trigger configuration is the process of defining and assigning run duration limits to automated triggers. This process involves specifying the trigger's execution parameters, including the maximum allowed run duration, to ensure that the trigger executes within predefined constraints.

### 5.2 Run Duration Limit
A run duration limit is a predefined constraint that restricts the execution time of a trigger. This limit can be based on various factors, including the trigger's complexity, the available system resources, and the potential impact of the trigger's execution on the system.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The core concepts of trigger configuration, run duration limit, and timeout interact with one another in that a trigger's configuration determines its run duration limit, which in turn affects the trigger's execution behavior. The constraints that govern these interactions include the trigger's execution parameters, the available system resources, and the predefined run duration limits.

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for automated trigger run duration limits involves assigning a predefined run duration limit to each trigger, which determines how long the trigger can execute before it is terminated. The model also includes a mechanism for monitoring and enforcing the run duration limits to prevent excessive resource utilization or other negative consequences.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that:
* Triggers are configured with predefined run duration limits.
* The system has sufficient resources to execute the triggers within their assigned run duration limits.
* The triggers are designed to execute within their assigned run duration limits.

### 6.3 Invariants
The following properties must always hold true within the standard model:
* A trigger's run duration limit is always greater than or equal to zero.
* A trigger's execution time is always less than or equal to its assigned run duration limit.
* The system's resources are always sufficient to execute the triggers within their assigned run duration limits.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern A: Trigger Timeout
- **Intent:** To prevent a trigger from executing indefinitely and consuming excessive system resources.
- **Context:** When a trigger's execution time is uncertain or unpredictable.
- **Tradeoffs:** The tradeoff is between preventing excessive resource utilization and potentially terminating a trigger prematurely.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern A: Unlimited Trigger Execution
- **Description:** Allowing a trigger to execute indefinitely without any run duration limits.
- **Failure Mode:** This anti-pattern can lead to excessive resource utilization, system crashes, or security vulnerabilities.
- **Common Causes:** This anti-pattern often occurs due to inadequate trigger configuration, insufficient monitoring, or a lack of understanding of the trigger's execution behavior.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Edge cases and boundary conditions that may challenge the standard model include:
* Triggers with variable or unpredictable execution times.
* Triggers that execute in parallel or concurrently.
* Triggers that have dependencies on other triggers or system components.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.
