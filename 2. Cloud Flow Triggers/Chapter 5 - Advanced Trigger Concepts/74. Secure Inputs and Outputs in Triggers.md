# 74. Secure Inputs and Outputs in Triggers

Canonical documentation for 74. Secure Inputs and Outputs in Triggers. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The topic of Secure Inputs and Outputs in Triggers exists to address the class of problems related to ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data exchanged between triggers and their associated systems. Triggers, being pivotal in automating workflows and processes, pose significant risks if their inputs and outputs are not properly secured. Misunderstanding or inconsistent application of security principles in this context can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and system compromises. The primary goal is to provide a framework that mitigates these risks, ensuring that triggers operate within a secure environment that protects sensitive information.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of Secure Inputs and Outputs in Triggers involves several major components:
- **Triggers**: These are the automated actions or events that initiate workflows or processes.
- **Inputs**: Data or signals that triggers receive to execute their intended actions.
- **Outputs**: Results or data produced by triggers as a consequence of their execution.
- **Security Mechanisms**: These include encryption, authentication, authorization, and access control, which are crucial for protecting inputs and outputs.

These components interact to produce secure, reliable, and trustworthy trigger operations. The model is designed to ensure that triggers can be executed in a manner that maintains the security and integrity of the data they handle, thereby preventing unauthorized access, tampering, or breaches.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

Clarify the explicit boundaries of this documentation.

**In scope:**
* Conceptual framework for securing trigger inputs and outputs
* Security mechanisms and protocols applicable to triggers
* Best practices for implementing secure triggers

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations of trigger security
* Vendor-specific behavior or configurations
* Operational or procedural guidance for managing triggers in production environments

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

Provide precise, stable definitions for all key terms used throughout this document.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Trigger | An automated action or event that initiates a workflow or process. |
| Secure Input | Data or signals received by a trigger that are protected against unauthorized access, tampering, or eavesdropping. |
| Secure Output | Data or results produced by a trigger that are protected against unauthorized access, tampering, or eavesdropping. |
| Authentication | The process of verifying the identity of entities interacting with triggers. |
| Authorization | The process of determining the access rights of entities to trigger inputs and outputs. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.

### 5.1 Trigger Security
Trigger security refers to the practices, protocols, and technologies used to protect triggers from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. This includes securing both the trigger itself and the data it handles.

### 5.2 Data Encryption
Data encryption is a critical security mechanism for protecting trigger inputs and outputs. It involves converting plaintext data into unreadable ciphertext to prevent unauthorized access.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
Triggers, inputs, outputs, and security mechanisms interact within the constraints of authentication, authorization, and data encryption. For instance, triggers must authenticate entities before executing, and outputs must be encrypted to prevent eavesdropping. These interactions and constraints are fundamental to ensuring the secure operation of triggers.

## 6. Standard Model

Describe the generally accepted or recommended model for this topic.

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for Secure Inputs and Outputs in Triggers involves a layered approach to security:
1. **Authentication and Authorization**: Verify the identity of and permissions for entities interacting with triggers.
2. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt all data exchanged between triggers and other systems.
3. **Access Control**: Implement role-based or attribute-based access control to restrict access to trigger inputs and outputs.

### 6.2 Assumptions
This model assumes that triggers are executed within a trusted environment and that the security mechanisms (authentication, authorization, encryption) are correctly implemented and maintained.

### 6.3 Invariants
The following properties must always hold true within the model:
- Triggers are authenticated before execution.
- Trigger inputs and outputs are encrypted.
- Access to triggers and their data is controlled and audited.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

Document recurring, accepted patterns associated with this topic.

### Pattern: Secure Trigger Communication
- **Intent:** To protect data exchanged between triggers and other systems.
- **Context:** When triggers handle sensitive data.
- **Tradeoffs:** Increased complexity due to encryption and authentication mechanisms, but significantly improved security.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

Describe common but discouraged practices.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- **Description:** Exposing internal trigger implementation details or sensitive data through outputs.
- **Failure Mode:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Common Causes:** Lack of input validation, inadequate access controls, or insufficient encryption.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Explain unusual or ambiguous scenarios that may challenge the standard model.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.

### Edge Case: Trigger Execution Across Trust Boundaries
When triggers execute across different trust boundaries (e.g., between different organizations or security zones), additional security considerations must be taken into account, such as establishing trust relationships, managing identities, and ensuring consistent security policies.
