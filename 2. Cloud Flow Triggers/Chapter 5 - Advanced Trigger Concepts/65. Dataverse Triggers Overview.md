# 65. Dataverse Triggers Overview

Canonical documentation for 65. Dataverse Triggers Overview. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

Dataverse triggers are designed to address the need for automated data processing and event handling within the Dataverse ecosystem. The class of problems it addresses includes data synchronization, validation, and notification. When misunderstood or inconsistently applied, Dataverse triggers can lead to data inconsistencies, processing errors, or security vulnerabilities. The risks associated with incorrect trigger implementation include data loss, system downtime, or unauthorized access.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of Dataverse triggers consists of three major components: 
- **Triggers**: The events that initiate the automated processing, such as data creation, update, or deletion.
- **Actions**: The automated processes that are executed in response to the triggers, such as data validation, notification, or synchronization.
- **Conditions**: The criteria that determine whether the actions are executed, such as specific data values or user roles.

These components interact to produce outcomes such as data consistency, automated workflows, and enhanced security. The model is designed to provide a flexible and scalable framework for managing data-driven events within the Dataverse ecosystem.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

**In scope:**
* Trigger types (e.g., create, update, delete)
* Action types (e.g., validation, notification, synchronization)
* Condition types (e.g., data values, user roles)

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations (e.g., Microsoft Power Apps, Azure Logic Apps)
* Vendor-specific behavior (e.g., Microsoft, Amazon)
* Operational or procedural guidance (e.g., deployment, maintenance)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Trigger | An event that initiates automated processing, such as data creation or update. |
| Action | An automated process executed in response to a trigger, such as data validation or notification. |
| Condition | A criterion that determines whether an action is executed, such as a specific data value or user role. |
| Dataverse | A cloud-based data platform for storing, managing, and integrating data from various sources. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Triggers
Triggers are the events that initiate automated processing within the Dataverse ecosystem. They can be categorized into three types: create, update, and delete. Each trigger type has a specific role within the overall model, such as validating data during creation or synchronizing data during update.

### 5.2 Actions
Actions are the automated processes executed in response to triggers. They can be categorized into three types: validation, notification, and synchronization. Each action type has constraints or dependencies, such as data values or user roles, that determine whether it is executed.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
Triggers, actions, and conditions interact to produce outcomes such as data consistency and automated workflows. The interactions are governed by constraints such as trigger-action-condition relationships, data dependencies, and user roles. For example, a create trigger may initiate a validation action only if the data values meet specific conditions.

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for Dataverse triggers consists of a trigger-action-condition framework. The model provides a flexible and scalable structure for managing data-driven events within the Dataverse ecosystem. The framework includes trigger types, action types, and condition types that interact to produce outcomes such as data consistency and automated workflows.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that the Dataverse ecosystem is properly configured, data is accurately defined, and user roles are correctly assigned. The model also assumes that triggers, actions, and conditions are correctly implemented and maintained.

### 6.3 Invariants
The standard model has several invariants that must always hold true, including:
* Triggers are executed in response to specific events.
* Actions are executed in response to triggers and conditions.
* Conditions are evaluated to determine whether actions are executed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern A: Data Validation
- **Intent:** Validate data during creation or update to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Context:** Typically applied during data ingestion or update processes.
- **Tradeoffs:** Ensures data quality, but may introduce additional processing overhead.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern A: Overly Complex Triggers
- **Description:** Triggers that are overly complex or nested, leading to maintenance and scalability issues.
- **Failure Mode:** Triggers may fail to execute correctly or may introduce performance bottlenecks.
- **Common Causes:** Lack of proper design or testing, or inadequate understanding of trigger interactions.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Edge cases and boundary conditions may challenge the standard model, such as:
* Handling duplicate or conflicting data values.
* Managing triggers and actions across multiple data sources.
* Ensuring data consistency during concurrent updates.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.
