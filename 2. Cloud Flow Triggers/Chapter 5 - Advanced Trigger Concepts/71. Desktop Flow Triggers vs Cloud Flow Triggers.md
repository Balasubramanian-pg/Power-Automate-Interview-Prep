# 71. Desktop Flow Triggers vs Cloud Flow Triggers

Canonical documentation for 71. Desktop Flow Triggers vs Cloud Flow Triggers. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The topic of Desktop Flow Triggers vs Cloud Flow Triggers exists to address the class of problems related to automating workflows and business processes in different environments. The primary problem this topic aims to solve is the inconsistency and confusion that arise when designing, implementing, and managing triggers for workflows that span both desktop and cloud-based systems. The risks or failures that arise when this topic is misunderstood or inconsistently applied include inefficient workflow automation, data inconsistencies, and security vulnerabilities. This section is descriptive, not instructional, and provides an overview of the importance of understanding the differences between desktop flow triggers and cloud flow triggers.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of Desktop Flow Triggers vs Cloud Flow Triggers consists of three major components: 
1. **Triggers**: Events or conditions that initiate a workflow or business process.
2. **Workflow Engines**: Systems responsible for executing workflows, which can be either desktop-based or cloud-based.
3. **Integration Mechanisms**: Technologies or protocols that enable communication and data exchange between different systems and environments.

These components relate to one another in the following way: Triggers are used to initiate workflows, which are then executed by workflow engines. Integration mechanisms facilitate the interaction between different systems and environments, ensuring seamless data exchange and workflow execution. The outcome of this model is to provide a robust, scalable, and secure workflow automation framework that can adapt to different environments and requirements.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

The scope of this documentation includes:
* **Trigger Types**: Definitions and explanations of different trigger types, including desktop flow triggers and cloud flow triggers.
* **Workflow Engine Integration**: Guidance on integrating workflow engines with triggers and other systems.

Out of scope are:
* **Tool-specific implementations**: Documentation of specific tools or software for workflow automation.
* **Vendor-specific behavior**: Details on how specific vendors implement workflow triggers and engines.
* **Operational or procedural guidance**: Step-by-step instructions for operating or managing workflow systems.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Desktop Flow Trigger | An event or condition that initiates a workflow on a desktop-based system. |
| Cloud Flow Trigger | An event or condition that initiates a workflow on a cloud-based system. |
| Workflow Engine | A system responsible for executing workflows, which can be either desktop-based or cloud-based. |
| Integration Mechanism | A technology or protocol that enables communication and data exchange between different systems and environments. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Desktop Flow Triggers
Desktop flow triggers are events or conditions that initiate workflows on desktop-based systems. These triggers are typically used for automating tasks that are specific to desktop environments, such as file system events or application-specific actions.

### 5.2 Cloud Flow Triggers
Cloud flow triggers are events or conditions that initiate workflows on cloud-based systems. These triggers are often used for automating tasks that involve cloud services, such as changes to cloud storage or notifications from cloud-based applications.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
Desktop flow triggers and cloud flow triggers interact through integration mechanisms, which enable data exchange and workflow execution across different environments. A key constraint is ensuring that triggers are properly configured to initiate the correct workflows, considering factors such as trigger frequency, data consistency, and security.

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for Desktop Flow Triggers vs Cloud Flow Triggers involves a layered architecture:
1. **Trigger Layer**: Where triggers are defined and managed.
2. **Workflow Engine Layer**: Where workflows are executed.
3. **Integration Layer**: Where data exchange and communication between systems occur.

### 6.2 Assumptions
This model assumes that:
- Triggers are properly configured and validated.
- Workflow engines are capable of executing workflows as intended.
- Integration mechanisms are secure and reliable.

### 6.3 Invariants
The following properties must always hold true:
- Triggers must be unique and identifiable.
- Workflows must be executed in a consistent and predictable manner.
- Data exchanged between systems must be valid and secure.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern A: Hybrid Trigger Approach
- **Intent**: To leverage both desktop and cloud flow triggers for comprehensive workflow automation.
- **Context**: When workflows span both desktop and cloud environments.
- **Tradeoffs**: Increased complexity in trigger management vs. enhanced flexibility and scalability in workflow automation.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern A: Overreliance on Desktop Triggers
- **Description**: Relying solely on desktop flow triggers for workflow automation, even when cloud-based workflows are involved.
- **Failure Mode**: Inability to scale or adapt workflows to cloud environments, leading to inefficiencies and potential security risks.
- **Common Causes**: Lack of awareness about cloud flow triggers or underestimating the benefits of cloud-based workflow automation.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Edge cases include scenarios where triggers are initiated from unexpected sources or where workflows need to execute across environments with different security protocols. Boundary conditions involve the limits of trigger frequency, data volume, and workflow complexity that can be handled by the system.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.
