# 63. Debugging Triggers in Run History

Canonical documentation for 63. Debugging Triggers in Run History. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

Debugging triggers in run history is a critical aspect of ensuring the reliability and efficiency of automated workflows and data pipelines. The primary purpose of this topic is to address the class of problems related to identifying, analyzing, and resolving issues with triggers that initiate or halt workflow runs. When triggers are not properly configured or debugged, it can lead to incorrect or incomplete data processing, workflow failures, and significant delays in downstream tasks. Misunderstanding or inconsistent application of trigger debugging principles can result in wasted resources, increased latency, and decreased overall system trustworthiness.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of debugging triggers in run history involves several key components:
- **Triggers**: These are the events or conditions that initiate a workflow run.
- **Run History**: This refers to the record of all past workflow runs, including their outcomes (success, failure, or cancellation).
- **Debugging Tools and Techniques**: These are the methods and software used to identify and diagnose issues with triggers.

The major conceptual components relate to one another as follows: Triggers are evaluated against certain conditions or events, and when these conditions are met, they initiate a workflow run. The run history stores information about each run, including any errors or issues encountered. Debugging tools and techniques are applied to analyze the run history and trigger configurations to identify and resolve problems.

The outcome this model is designed to produce is a reliable and efficient workflow execution process, where triggers correctly initiate runs under the expected conditions, and any issues are quickly and effectively diagnosed and resolved.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

Clarify the explicit boundaries of this documentation.

**In scope:**
* Conceptual models of trigger debugging
* Terminology and definitions related to trigger debugging
* Core concepts and standard models for debugging triggers in run history

**Out of scope:**

> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

Provide precise, stable definitions for all key terms used throughout this document.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Trigger | An event or condition that initiates a workflow run. |
| Run History | A record of all past workflow runs, including their outcomes. |
| Debugging | The process of identifying and diagnosing issues with triggers or workflow runs. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.

### 5.1 Trigger Types
High-level explanation: Triggers can be categorized based on their initiation mechanism, such as time-based, event-based, or manual. Each type of trigger has its role within the overall model, influencing when and how workflow runs are initiated.

### 5.2 Run History Analysis
High-level explanation: Analyzing the run history involves examining the records of past workflow runs to identify patterns, errors, or anomalies that could indicate issues with triggers. This analysis is constrained by the availability and quality of the run history data.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The core concepts interact as follows: Trigger types determine how workflow runs are initiated, and run history analysis provides insights into the effectiveness and correctness of these initiations. Constraints include the need for accurate and complete run history data, as well as the limitations of debugging tools and techniques in identifying complex issues.

## 6. Standard Model

Describe the generally accepted or recommended model for this topic.

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for debugging triggers in run history involves a systematic approach:
1. **Identification**: Recognize the issue through monitoring or reporting.
2. **Analysis**: Use run history and debugging tools to understand the cause.
3. **Resolution**: Apply fixes or adjustments to the trigger configuration.
4. **Verification**: Confirm that the issue is resolved through testing or subsequent runs.

### 6.2 Assumptions
This model assumes that:
- Accurate and complete run history data is available.
- Appropriate debugging tools and techniques are accessible.
- The workflow and trigger configurations are well-documented and understandable.

### 6.3 Invariants
Properties that must always hold true within this model include:
- Triggers are correctly configured to initiate runs under the expected conditions.
- Run history accurately reflects all workflow runs and their outcomes.
- Debugging processes are systematic and thorough.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

Document recurring, accepted patterns associated with this topic.

### Pattern: Regular Trigger Review
- **Intent**: Ensure triggers are correctly configured and functioning as expected.
- **Context**: Applied periodically or after significant workflow changes.
- **Tradeoffs**: Time spent on review versus potential issues prevented.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

Describe common but discouraged practices.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern: Ignoring Run History
- **Description**: Failing to regularly analyze run history for issues or trends.
- **Failure Mode**: Missed opportunities to identify and resolve recurring problems.
- **Common Causes**: Lack of time, inadequate tools, or insufficient understanding of run history analysis.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Explain unusual or ambiguous scenarios that may challenge the standard model.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.

Examples include triggers that are sensitive to specific environmental conditions or workflows that have complex, conditional logic for run initiation.
