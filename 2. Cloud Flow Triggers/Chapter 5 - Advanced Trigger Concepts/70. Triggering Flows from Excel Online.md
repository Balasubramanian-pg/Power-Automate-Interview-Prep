# 70. Triggering Flows from Excel Online

Canonical documentation for 70. Triggering Flows from Excel Online. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The topic of triggering flows from Excel Online exists to address the need for automating workflows and integrating data from Excel spreadsheets into larger business processes. This class of problems involves the challenges of manually updating data, synchronizing information across different systems, and ensuring data consistency and accuracy. The risks or failures that arise when this topic is misunderstood or inconsistently applied include data inconsistencies, process inefficiencies, and potential security vulnerabilities. For instance, if flows are not properly triggered or data is not correctly validated, it can lead to incorrect decisions or actions being taken based on that data.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of triggering flows from Excel Online involves several major components:
- **Excel Online**: The cloud-based version of Microsoft Excel, which allows for real-time collaboration and automatic saving of spreadsheets.
- **Flows**: Automated workflows that can be triggered by specific events or conditions, such as changes to an Excel spreadsheet.
- **Triggers**: The mechanisms by which flows are initiated, which can include updates to specific cells, changes in data ranges, or other events within Excel Online.
- **Connectors**: The interfaces that allow Excel Online to communicate with other systems or services, enabling the integration of data and the triggering of flows.

These components relate to one another in that changes or events in Excel Online can trigger flows through connectors, which then automate specific tasks or workflows. The outcome of this model is designed to produce efficient, automated processes that minimize manual intervention and reduce the risk of human error.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

The explicit boundaries of this documentation are defined as follows:

**In scope:**
* Conceptual models of triggering flows from Excel Online
* Terminology and definitions related to this topic
* Core concepts and standard models for flow triggering
* Common patterns and anti-patterns in flow triggering

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations of flow triggering (e.g., Microsoft Power Automate)
* Vendor-specific behavior or limitations
* Operational or procedural guidance for setting up or managing flows

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

The following terms are defined for clarity and consistency throughout this document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Flow | An automated workflow that can be triggered by specific events or conditions. |
| Trigger | A mechanism by which a flow is initiated, such as a change to an Excel spreadsheet. |
| Connector | An interface that enables communication between Excel Online and other systems or services. |
| Excel Online | The cloud-based version of Microsoft Excel, facilitating real-time collaboration and automatic saving of spreadsheets. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Flows
Flows are the automated workflows that can be triggered from Excel Online. They are designed to automate specific tasks or processes, reducing manual intervention and the risk of error. Flows can be triggered by a variety of events or conditions, including changes to data within Excel spreadsheets.

### 5.2 Triggers
Triggers are the specific events or conditions that initiate flows. In the context of Excel Online, triggers can include updates to specific cells, changes in data ranges, or other events that occur within the spreadsheet. The configuration of triggers is crucial for ensuring that flows are initiated at the appropriate times.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The core concepts of flows, triggers, and connectors interact in that triggers initiate flows, which then execute through connectors to integrate data and automate tasks. A key constraint is that triggers must be properly configured to ensure that flows are initiated correctly and that data is accurately integrated. Additionally, the design of flows must consider the specific requirements and constraints of the tasks or processes being automated.

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for triggering flows from Excel Online involves the following structure and behavior:
1. **Event Occurrence**: An event or condition occurs within Excel Online, such as a change to a specific cell or data range.
2. **Trigger Activation**: The event triggers the activation of a flow, which has been configured to respond to that specific event or condition.
3. **Flow Execution**: The triggered flow executes, automating the specified tasks or processes. This may involve integrating data with other systems or services through connectors.
4. **Flow Completion**: The flow completes its execution, having automated the desired tasks or processes.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that:
- Excel Online is properly configured and accessible.
- Flows are correctly designed and configured to respond to specific triggers.
- Connectors are properly set up to facilitate data integration with other systems or services.

### 6.3 Invariants
The following properties must always hold true within the standard model:
- Flows are triggered by specific, well-defined events or conditions.
- Triggers are configured to initiate flows correctly and consistently.
- Data integrated through connectors is accurate and consistent.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern A: Automated Data Synchronization
- **Intent**: To automate the synchronization of data between Excel Online and other systems or services, ensuring data consistency and reducing manual effort.
- **Context**: This pattern is typically applied when there is a need for real-time or near-real-time data synchronization across different systems.
- **Tradeoffs**: While this pattern offers significant benefits in terms of automation and data consistency, it may require additional setup and configuration of flows and connectors.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern A: Manual Flow Triggering
- **Description**: Manually triggering flows instead of configuring automated triggers based on events or conditions within Excel Online.
- **Failure Mode**: This anti-pattern can lead to inefficiencies, as manual intervention is required to trigger flows, and it increases the risk of human error.
- **Common Causes**: Teams may fall into this anti-pattern due to a lack of understanding of how to configure automated triggers or due to the complexity of the events or conditions that need to be monitored.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Edge cases may include scenarios where the data being updated in Excel Online is not in a standard format, or where the triggers are based on complex conditions that are difficult to define. Boundary conditions may involve the limits of what can be automated through flows, such as complex decision-making processes that require human judgment.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.
