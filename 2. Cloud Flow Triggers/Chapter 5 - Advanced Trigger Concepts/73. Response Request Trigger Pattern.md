# 73. Response Request Trigger Pattern

Canonical documentation for 73. Response Request Trigger Pattern. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The Response Request Trigger Pattern exists to address the class of problems related to handling asynchronous requests and responses in distributed systems. This pattern is crucial for ensuring that systems can efficiently manage and process requests, providing timely and accurate responses. Misunderstanding or inconsistent application of this pattern can lead to issues such as request loss, response delays, and system overload, ultimately resulting in poor user experience and potential system failures.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The Response Request Trigger Pattern is based on a high-level mental model that involves the following major conceptual components:
- **Request Initiator**: The component that initiates a request.
- **Request Handler**: The component responsible for processing the request.
- **Response Generator**: The component that generates a response to the request.
- **Response Receiver**: The component that receives the response.

These components interact in a sequence where the Request Initiator sends a request to the Request Handler, which processes the request and triggers the Response Generator to produce a response. The response is then sent to the Response Receiver. The outcome of this model is to ensure that requests are processed efficiently and that responses are delivered accurately and in a timely manner.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

The explicit boundaries of this documentation are as follows:

**In scope:**
* Conceptual model of the Response Request Trigger Pattern
* Terminology and definitions related to the pattern
* Core concepts and their interactions
* Standard model for the pattern
* Common patterns and anti-patterns

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations of the pattern
* Vendor-specific behavior or customizations
* Operational or procedural guidance for applying the pattern

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

The following terms are defined for use throughout this document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Request | A message or signal sent from a Request Initiator to a Request Handler to initiate an action or process. |
| Response | A message or signal sent from a Response Generator to a Response Receiver as a result of processing a request. |
| Asynchronous Request | A request that does not block the Request Initiator, allowing it to continue processing other tasks while waiting for a response. |
| Synchronous Request | A request that blocks the Request Initiator until a response is received. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Request Initiator
The Request Initiator is the component responsible for sending requests to the Request Handler. It plays a crucial role in the pattern by initiating the sequence of events that leads to the processing of a request and the generation of a response.

### 5.2 Request Handler
The Request Handler is the component that receives and processes requests from the Request Initiator. It is responsible for triggering the appropriate actions or processes in response to a request.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The Request Initiator, Request Handler, Response Generator, and Response Receiver interact in a specific sequence. The Request Initiator sends a request to the Request Handler, which then triggers the Response Generator to produce a response. The Response Generator sends the response to the Response Receiver. Constraints include ensuring that requests are properly formatted and that responses are generated within a reasonable timeframe.

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for the Response Request Trigger Pattern involves a sequence of steps:
1. The Request Initiator sends a request to the Request Handler.
2. The Request Handler processes the request and triggers the Response Generator.
3. The Response Generator produces a response based on the request.
4. The Response Generator sends the response to the Response Receiver.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The model assumes that the Request Initiator, Request Handler, Response Generator, and Response Receiver are properly configured and functioning correctly. It also assumes that the communication channels between these components are reliable and secure.

### 6.3 Invariants
The following properties must always hold true within the model:
- Each request must have a corresponding response.
- Responses must be generated within a reasonable timeframe after the request is processed.
- The sequence of events must follow the defined order (request, processing, response generation, response reception).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern A: Asynchronous Request Processing
- **Intent:** To process requests without blocking the Request Initiator, allowing for greater concurrency and system throughput.
- **Context:** When the Request Initiator needs to continue processing other tasks while waiting for a response.
- **Tradeoffs:** Increased complexity in managing asynchronous requests versus improved system responsiveness and throughput.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern A: Synchronous Request Blocking
- **Description:** Using synchronous requests in situations where asynchronous requests would be more appropriate, leading to blocked Request Initiators and reduced system throughput.
- **Failure Mode:** Reduced system responsiveness and throughput due to blocked Request Initiators.
- **Common Causes:** Misunderstanding of the differences between synchronous and asynchronous requests or failure to consider the impact on system performance.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Edge cases include scenarios where the Request Handler is unable to process a request due to errors or where the Response Generator fails to produce a response within the expected timeframe. Boundary conditions include the maximum number of concurrent requests that the system can handle and the minimum response time required for the system to be considered responsive.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.
