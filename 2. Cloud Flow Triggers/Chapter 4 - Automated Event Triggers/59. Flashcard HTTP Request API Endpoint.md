# 59. Flashcard HTTP Request API Endpoint

Canonical documentation for 59. Flashcard HTTP Request API Endpoint. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The Flashcard HTTP Request API Endpoint exists to facilitate the creation, retrieval, update, and deletion of flashcards over the web. This endpoint addresses the class of problems related to managing flashcard data in a scalable, secure, and standardized manner. The risks or failures that arise when this endpoint is misunderstood or inconsistently applied include data corruption, security vulnerabilities, and poor performance. Inconsistent application of this endpoint can lead to difficulties in maintaining and evolving the flashcard system, ultimately affecting the user experience and the overall effectiveness of the flashcard application.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The Flashcard HTTP Request API Endpoint conceptual model consists of the following major components:
- **Flashcard Resource**: Represents an individual flashcard with its associated data, such as question, answer, and tags.
- **HTTP Request Methods**: Define the actions that can be performed on the flashcard resource, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
- **API Endpoint**: Specifies the URL and parameters required to interact with the flashcard resource.

These components relate to one another in that the HTTP request methods are used to manipulate the flashcard resource through the API endpoint. The outcomes this model is designed to produce include reliable data storage, efficient data retrieval, and secure data modification.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

The explicit boundaries of this documentation are as follows:

**In scope:**
* Flashcard data model and schema
* HTTP request methods and their application to the flashcard resource
* API endpoint structure and parameters

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations of the Flashcard HTTP Request API Endpoint
* Vendor-specific behavior or customizations
* Operational or procedural guidance for deploying or managing the API endpoint

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

The following terms are defined for use throughout this document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Flashcard | A digital card containing a question on one side and the answer on the other, used for learning and memorization. |
| API Endpoint | A URL that defines the location of a specific resource or service on the web. |
| HTTP Request Method | A command sent by a client to a server to perform a specific action, such as GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE. |
| Resource | A discrete piece of data or functionality that can be accessed and manipulated through the API endpoint. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Flashcard Resource
The flashcard resource represents an individual flashcard with its associated data. This resource is the core entity manipulated by the API endpoint.

### 5.2 HTTP Request Methods
The HTTP request methods define the actions that can be performed on the flashcard resource. These methods include:
- **GET**: Retrieve a flashcard or a list of flashcards.
- **POST**: Create a new flashcard.
- **PUT**: Update an existing flashcard.
- **DELETE**: Delete a flashcard.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The flashcard resource and HTTP request methods interact through the API endpoint. Constraints on these interactions include:
- **Authentication**: Clients must authenticate before accessing or modifying flashcard resources.
- **Authorization**: Clients must have the necessary permissions to perform actions on flashcard resources.
- **Data Validation**: Flashcard data must conform to the defined schema and validation rules.

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for the Flashcard HTTP Request API Endpoint involves a RESTful API architecture, where the flashcard resource is accessed and manipulated using HTTP request methods. The API endpoint is structured to include the base URL, resource identifier, and query parameters as needed.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes:
- **Client-Server Architecture**: The API endpoint is deployed on a server, and clients access it over the web.
- **HTTP Protocol**: The API endpoint uses the HTTP protocol for communication.
- **JSON Data Format**: Flashcard data is exchanged in JSON format.

### 6.3 Invariants
The following properties must always hold true within the standard model:
- **Resource Identification**: Each flashcard resource has a unique identifier.
- **Data Consistency**: Flashcard data is consistent across all interactions with the API endpoint.
- **Security**: The API endpoint implements appropriate security measures to protect flashcard data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern A: Retrieving a Flashcard
- **Intent**: Retrieve a specific flashcard by its identifier.
- **Context**: When a client needs to display or update a flashcard.
- **Tradeoffs**: This pattern provides efficient retrieval of a single flashcard but may not be suitable for retrieving large numbers of flashcards.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern A: Insecure Data Transmission
- **Description**: Transmitting flashcard data without encryption or authentication.
- **Failure Mode**: Exposes flashcard data to unauthorized access or tampering.
- **Common Causes**: Neglecting security best practices or underestimating the importance of data protection.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Edge cases include scenarios such as:
- **Empty Flashcard List**: Handling the case when a client requests a list of flashcards, but no flashcards exist.
- **Invalid Flashcard Data**: Managing the situation when a client attempts to create or update a flashcard with invalid or malformed data.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.

## 10. Related Topics

- **RESTful API Design**: Principles and guidelines for designing RESTful APIs.
