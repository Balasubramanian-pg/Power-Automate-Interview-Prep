# 47. Get changes for an item or file Action

Canonical documentation for 47. Get changes for an item or file Action. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The "Get changes for an item or file Action" topic exists to address the need for efficient and accurate tracking of modifications made to items or files within various systems, such as version control systems, content management systems, or collaborative work environments. The class of problems it addresses includes versioning, change management, and auditing. Misunderstanding or inconsistent application of this concept can lead to data inconsistencies, loss of historical data, or difficulties in collaborative work, ultimately resulting in decreased productivity and increased risk of errors.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The high-level mental model of "Get changes for an item or file Action" involves several major conceptual components:
- **Items or Files**: The entities being tracked for changes.
- **Change Tracking Mechanism**: The system or process responsible for identifying and recording changes.
- **Change History**: The record of all changes made to an item or file over time.

These components relate to one another in that the change tracking mechanism operates on items or files to generate a change history. The outcome of this model is designed to produce a reliable and accessible record of changes, facilitating version control, collaboration, and auditing.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

Clarify the explicit boundaries of this documentation.

**In scope:**
* Conceptual models for change tracking
* Terminology and definitions related to change management
* Standard patterns and anti-patterns for getting changes

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations of change tracking (e.g., Git, SVN)
* Vendor-specific behavior or proprietary change management systems
* Operational or procedural guidance for implementing change tracking in specific environments

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

Provide precise, stable definitions for all key terms used throughout this document.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Item | A discrete entity that can be versioned or tracked, such as a file, document, or code snippet. |
| File | A named collection of data stored in a computer system, which can be subject to versioning. |
| Change | A modification, addition, or deletion made to an item or file. |
| Change History | A chronological record of all changes made to an item or file. |
| Version | A specific state of an item or file at a particular point in time. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.

### 5.1 Change Tracking
High-level explanation: Change tracking is the process of monitoring and recording changes made to items or files. Its role within the overall model is central, as it provides the mechanism for generating change histories.

### 5.2 Versioning
High-level explanation: Versioning is the process of managing different states (versions) of an item or file. It is closely related to change tracking, as each version represents a specific point in the change history.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The core concepts interact in that change tracking is used to identify and record changes, which in turn are used to create new versions of items or files. A key constraint is that change tracking must be accurate and comprehensive to ensure the integrity of the change history and versioning process.

## 6. Standard Model

Describe the generally accepted or recommended model for this topic.

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for "Get changes for an item or file Action" involves a change tracking mechanism that operates on items or files to generate a change history. This change history is then used to manage different versions of the items or files.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The model assumes that:
- Items or files can be uniquely identified.
- Changes can be accurately detected and recorded.
- The change history is persistently stored and accessible.

### 6.3 Invariants
The model invariants include:
- Each item or file has a unique identifier.
- The change history is chronological and comprehensive.
- Each version of an item or file corresponds to a specific point in the change history.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

Document recurring, accepted patterns associated with this topic.

### Pattern: Incremental Change Tracking
- **Intent:** To efficiently track changes by only recording the differences between successive versions of an item or file.
- **Context:** Typically applied in environments where storage space is limited or when dealing with very large items or files.
- **Tradeoffs:** Reduces storage requirements but may increase computational overhead when reconstructing a specific version.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

Describe common but discouraged practices.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern: Manual Change Tracking
- **Description:** Relying on manual processes to track changes, such as using spreadsheets or manual logs.
- **Failure Mode:** Prone to human error, inconsistent recording, and difficulty in scaling.
- **Common Causes:** Lack of awareness of automated change tracking tools or underestimating the volume of changes.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Explain unusual or ambiguous scenarios that may challenge the standard model.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.

- **Conflicting Changes:** Handling situations where multiple, conflicting changes are made to the same item or file simultaneously.
- **Item or File Deletion:** Managing the change history when an item or file is deleted, including whether the change history should also be deleted or retained.
