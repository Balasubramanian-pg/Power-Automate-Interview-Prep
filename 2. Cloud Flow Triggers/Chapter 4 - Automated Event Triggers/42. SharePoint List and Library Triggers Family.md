# 42. SharePoint List and Library Triggers Family

Canonical documentation for 42. SharePoint List and Library Triggers Family. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The SharePoint List and Library Triggers Family exists to address the need for automated workflows and event-driven actions within SharePoint environments. This topic class of problems involves creating, managing, and triggering custom actions in response to changes or events within SharePoint lists and libraries. The risks or failures that arise when this topic is misunderstood or inconsistently applied include inefficient workflow management, data inconsistencies, and security vulnerabilities. Inconsistent application of triggers can lead to unexpected behavior, errors, or even data loss, highlighting the importance of a well-defined and understood conceptual model.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The high-level mental model of the SharePoint List and Library Triggers Family involves several major conceptual components:
- **Triggers**: These are the events or conditions that initiate custom actions. Triggers can be based on item creation, modification, deletion, or other list and library events.
- **Actions**: These are the custom operations that are executed in response to triggers. Actions can range from simple notifications to complex workflows involving multiple steps and integrations.
- **Workflows**: These represent the sequences of actions that are automated based on triggers. Workflows can be simple or complex, involving conditional logic, loops, and interactions with other SharePoint components or external services.

These components relate to one another in that triggers initiate actions, which are then sequenced into workflows. The outcome of this model is to produce automated, event-driven processes that enhance productivity, consistency, and reliability within SharePoint environments.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

The explicit boundaries of this documentation are as follows:

**In scope:**
* Conceptual models of triggers, actions, and workflows
* Terminology and definitions related to SharePoint List and Library Triggers
* Core concepts and their interactions
* Standard models and patterns for trigger implementation

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations (e.g., Microsoft Power Automate, SharePoint Designer)
* Vendor-specific behavior or customizations
* Operational or procedural guidance for managing triggers and workflows

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

The following terms are defined for clarity and consistency throughout this document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Trigger | An event or condition that initiates a custom action or workflow within a SharePoint list or library. |
| Action | A custom operation executed in response to a trigger, which can range from simple notifications to complex workflows. |
| Workflow | A sequence of actions automated based on one or more triggers, designed to achieve a specific business process or outcome. |
| Item | A single entry or record within a SharePoint list or library. |
| Event | A specific occurrence or change within a SharePoint list or library, such as item creation, modification, or deletion. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions are crafted to avoid contextual or time-bound language, ensuring they remain valid as the SharePoint ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Triggers
Triggers are the foundational elements of the SharePoint List and Library Triggers Family, representing the events or conditions that initiate custom actions or workflows. Triggers can be categorized based on their source (e.g., item-level, list-level) and type (e.g., creation, modification).

### 5.2 Actions
Actions are the custom operations that are executed in response to triggers. They can be simple (e.g., sending a notification) or complex (e.g., initiating a multi-step workflow). Actions are a critical component of workflows, as they define the specific tasks that are automated.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
Triggers and actions interact through workflows, which define the sequence and conditions under which actions are executed. Constraints include trigger specificity (e.g., which events trigger actions), action dependencies (e.g., which actions must precede others), and workflow logic (e.g., conditional statements, loops).

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for SharePoint List and Library Triggers involves a trigger-action-workflow sequence. Triggers are defined based on specific events or conditions within lists and libraries. When a trigger is activated, it initiates one or more actions, which are then sequenced into a workflow. This workflow can involve conditional logic, iterations, and interactions with other SharePoint components or external services.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that:
- Triggers are correctly configured and validated.
- Actions are properly defined and sequenced.
- Workflows are logically consistent and achievable given the defined triggers and actions.

### 6.3 Invariants
Properties that must always hold true within the standard model include:
- Triggers must be uniquely identifiable and unambiguously defined.
- Actions must be executable and properly sequenced within workflows.
- Workflows must terminate (either successfully or with an error) to maintain system integrity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified to ensure maintainability and scalability.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern: Automated Notification
- **Intent:** To notify stakeholders of changes or events within SharePoint lists and libraries.
- **Context:** When transparency and communication are crucial for team collaboration and decision-making.
- **Tradeoffs:** Balancing the need for information with potential notification overload.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern: Overly Complex Workflows
- **Description:** Workflows that are excessively intricate, involving numerous conditional statements, loops, and actions.
- **Failure Mode:** Such workflows can become difficult to maintain, debug, and understand, leading to errors and inefficiencies.
- **Common Causes:** Lack of planning, insufficient testing, and failure to simplify workflows through modular design.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Edge cases include scenarios where triggers are activated by bulk operations (e.g., multiple items being updated simultaneously) or when workflows involve external services with variable response times. Boundary conditions might involve the maximum number of triggers that can be defined for a list or library, or the limits on workflow complexity.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.
