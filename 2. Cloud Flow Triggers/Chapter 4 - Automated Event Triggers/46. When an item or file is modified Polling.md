# 46. When an item or file is modified Polling

Canonical documentation for 46. When an item or file is modified Polling. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The topic of polling when an item or file is modified exists to address the class of problems related to real-time monitoring and synchronization of data across systems, applications, or services. The primary problem it addresses is how to efficiently and reliably detect changes to items or files, ensuring that all stakeholders or dependent systems are notified and updated accordingly. The risks or failures that arise when this topic is misunderstood or inconsistently applied include data inconsistencies, delays in processing updates, and potential losses due to outdated information. Misunderstanding or misapplication can lead to inefficiencies, such as excessive resource utilization for frequent polling, or failures, such as missing critical updates due to infrequent checks.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of polling when an item or file is modified involves several major components:
- **Polling Mechanism:** The process or method by which a system checks for modifications.
- **Item/File Repository:** The storage or location where items or files are kept and modified.
- **Notification System:** The component responsible for alerting stakeholders or dependent systems of changes.
These components relate to one another in a cycle where the polling mechanism periodically checks the item/file repository for changes, and upon detecting a modification, it triggers the notification system to alert relevant parties. The outcome this model is designed to produce is real-time or near-real-time synchronization and awareness of changes to items or files across all relevant systems and stakeholders.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

The scope of this documentation includes:
**In scope:**
* Conceptual models of polling mechanisms
* Strategies for optimizing polling frequency and resource utilization
* Integration with notification systems for change alerts

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations of polling (e.g., using specific programming languages or libraries)
* Vendor-specific behavior or recommendations for polling in proprietary systems
* Operational or procedural guidance for managing polling in production environments

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Polling | The act of periodically checking a system, repository, or location for updates or changes. |
| Item/File Modification | Any change, addition, or deletion made to an item or file within a repository. |
| Notification System | A component or service responsible for alerting stakeholders or dependent systems of detected changes. |
| Polling Interval | The time gap between two consecutive polls. |
| Real-time Synchronization | The process of ensuring that all relevant systems and stakeholders have the most current version of an item or file. |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Polling Mechanism
The polling mechanism is the heart of the system, responsible for periodically checking for modifications. Its role within the overall model is crucial for detecting changes and triggering notifications.

### 5.2 Item/File Repository
The item/file repository is where all items or files are stored. It can be a database, file system, or any other form of storage. Constraints or dependencies include ensuring the repository is accessible and that changes can be detected.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The polling mechanism interacts with the item/file repository to detect changes. A required relationship exists between the polling frequency and the nature of the items/files being monitored; for example, critical files may require more frequent polling. Constraints include balancing the need for real-time updates against the resource utilization and potential overhead of frequent polling.

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for polling when an item or file is modified involves setting up a polling mechanism to periodically check the item/file repository for changes. Upon detecting a modification, it triggers a notification to relevant stakeholders or systems.

### 6.2 Assumptions
Assumptions under which the model is valid include:
- The item/file repository is accessible and supports change detection.
- The polling mechanism can reliably detect changes.
- The notification system can effectively alert stakeholders.

### 6.3 Invariants
Properties that must always hold true within the model include:
- The polling mechanism must operate within defined intervals to balance resource utilization and update latency.
- Detected changes must trigger notifications to maintain synchronization.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern A: Adaptive Polling
- **Intent:** Adjust polling frequency based on the rate of changes to optimize resource utilization and reduce latency.
- **Context:** Applies well in environments where the change rate is variable and unpredictable.
- **Tradeoffs:** Offers flexibility but may introduce complexity in managing adaptive polling intervals.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern A: Over-Polling
- **Description:** Polling at an excessively high frequency, leading to unnecessary resource utilization without significant benefits in update latency.
- **Failure Mode:** Results in wasted resources, potential system overload, and decreased overall system performance.
- **Common Causes:** Lack of understanding of the trade-offs between polling frequency and resource utilization, or an overemphasis on achieving real-time updates without considering the costs.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Edge cases include scenarios where the item/file repository is temporarily inaccessible, or the polling mechanism fails to detect changes due to repository constraints (e.g., permissions issues). Boundary conditions might involve the maximum polling frequency before it becomes counterproductive, or the minimum frequency that still allows for near-real-time synchronization.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.
