# 55. HTTP Request JSON Schema Definition

Canonical documentation for 55. HTTP Request JSON Schema Definition. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

The HTTP Request JSON Schema Definition exists to provide a standardized framework for describing and validating the structure of HTTP requests that utilize JSON data. This topic addresses the class of problems related to ensuring data consistency, accuracy, and interoperability in web applications and services that rely on JSON-encoded HTTP requests. The risks or failures that arise when this topic is misunderstood or inconsistently applied include data corruption, security vulnerabilities, and integration issues between different systems or services.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The high-level mental model of the HTTP Request JSON Schema Definition consists of three major conceptual components:
- **JSON Schema**: A vocabulary that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.
- **HTTP Request**: A message sent by a client to a server to request an action be taken on the server's resources.
- **Validation**: The process of checking that the JSON data in an HTTP request conforms to a predefined schema.

These components relate to one another in that the JSON Schema is used to define the structure and constraints of the JSON data in an HTTP request, and validation is the process of ensuring that the JSON data conforms to this schema. The outcome of this model is to produce a robust, maintainable, and scalable way to handle JSON data in HTTP requests.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

The explicit boundaries of this documentation are as follows:

**In scope:**
* The definition and usage of JSON Schema for HTTP requests
* The validation process of JSON data against a predefined schema
* Best practices for designing and implementing JSON Schema for HTTP requests

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations of JSON Schema validation
* Vendor-specific behavior or extensions to the JSON Schema standard
* Operational or procedural guidance for deploying and managing systems that use JSON Schema for HTTP requests

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

The following terms are defined for use throughout this document:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| JSON Schema | A vocabulary for annotating and validating JSON documents |
| HTTP Request | A message sent by a client to a server to request an action be taken on the server's resources |
| Validation | The process of checking that JSON data conforms to a predefined schema |
| Schema | A predefined structure that defines the constraints and expectations for JSON data |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 JSON Schema
JSON Schema is a fundamental concept that provides a way to describe the structure and constraints of JSON data. It is used to define the expected format and content of JSON data in an HTTP request.

### 5.2 HTTP Request
An HTTP request is a message sent by a client to a server to request an action be taken on the server's resources. In the context of this topic, HTTP requests are used to send JSON data to a server for processing.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
The core concepts interact in that the JSON Schema is used to validate the JSON data in an HTTP request. The constraints defined in the JSON Schema, such as data types and relationships between properties, are used to ensure that the JSON data is valid and consistent.

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for using JSON Schema with HTTP requests involves defining a JSON Schema that describes the expected structure and constraints of the JSON data in an HTTP request. The JSON data is then validated against this schema to ensure that it conforms to the expected format and content.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that the JSON Schema is correctly defined and that the JSON data in the HTTP request is well-formed and valid according to the schema.

### 6.3 Invariants
The following properties must always hold true in the standard model:
- The JSON data in an HTTP request must conform to the predefined JSON Schema.
- The JSON Schema must be correctly defined and valid according to the JSON Schema standard.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern A: Using JSON Schema for Request Validation
- **Intent:** To ensure that JSON data in an HTTP request is valid and consistent with the expected format and content.
- **Context:** When receiving JSON data in an HTTP request and needing to validate its structure and constraints.
- **Tradeoffs:** Provides robust validation and error handling, but may add complexity to the system.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern A: Ignoring JSON Schema Validation
- **Description:** Failing to validate JSON data in an HTTP request against a predefined schema.
- **Failure Mode:** Leads to incorrect or inconsistent data being processed, potentially causing errors or security vulnerabilities.
- **Common Causes:** Lack of understanding of the importance of validation, or underestimating the complexity of the JSON data.

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Edge cases and boundary conditions that may challenge the standard model include:
- Handling optional or nullable properties in the JSON Schema
- Dealing with circular references or recursive structures in the JSON data
- Supporting multiple versions of the JSON Schema

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.
