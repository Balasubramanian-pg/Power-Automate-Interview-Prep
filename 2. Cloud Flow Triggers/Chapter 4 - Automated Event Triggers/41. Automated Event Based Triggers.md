# 41. Automated Event Based Triggers

Canonical documentation for 41. Automated Event Based Triggers. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, constraints, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space

Automated Event Based Triggers exist to address the need for efficient, real-time responses to specific events within complex systems. The class of problems it addresses includes the management of asynchronous events, the automation of workflows, and the optimization of system performance. When misunderstood or inconsistently applied, Automated Event Based Triggers can lead to issues such as incorrect event handling, delayed responses, or even system crashes. The risks associated with the misuse of Automated Event Based Triggers include decreased system reliability, increased maintenance costs, and compromised data integrity.

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The conceptual model of Automated Event Based Triggers consists of three major components: Event Producers, Event Handlers, and Trigger Mechanisms. Event Producers generate events in response to specific system changes or user interactions. Event Handlers process these events and perform the necessary actions. Trigger Mechanisms connect Event Producers to Event Handlers, ensuring that the correct handlers are invoked for each event. The outcomes of this model include improved system responsiveness, enhanced automation capabilities, and reduced manual intervention.

## 3. Scope and Non-Goals

The scope of this documentation includes:

**In scope:**
* Conceptual foundations of Automated Event Based Triggers
* Terminology and definitions
* Core concepts and interactions
* Standard model and common patterns

**Out of scope:**
* Tool-specific implementations
* Vendor-specific behavior
* Operational or procedural guidance

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Out-of-scope items may be addressed in companion or derivative documentation.

## 4. Terminology and Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Event | A significant change in state or an occurrence that requires a response |
| Event Producer | A component that generates events in response to system changes or user interactions |
| Event Handler | A component that processes events and performs the necessary actions |
| Trigger Mechanism | A component that connects Event Producers to Event Handlers |
| Automation | The use of Automated Event Based Triggers to perform tasks without human intervention |

> [!TIP]
> Definitions should avoid contextual or time-bound language and remain valid as the ecosystem evolves.

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Event Producers
Event Producers are responsible for generating events in response to system changes or user interactions. They play a crucial role in the Automated Event Based Triggers model, as they provide the input that drives the automation process.

### 5.2 Event Handlers
Event Handlers process events generated by Event Producers and perform the necessary actions. They are the core components that execute the automated workflows and responses.

### 5.3 Concept Interactions and Constraints
Event Producers and Event Handlers interact through Trigger Mechanisms, which ensure that the correct handlers are invoked for each event. The constraints of this interaction include the requirement for Event Producers to generate events in a standardized format and for Event Handlers to be able to process these events correctly.

## 6. Standard Model

### 6.1 Model Description
The standard model for Automated Event Based Triggers consists of a decentralized architecture, where Event Producers and Event Handlers are loosely coupled through Trigger Mechanisms. This architecture allows for flexibility, scalability, and fault tolerance.

### 6.2 Assumptions
The standard model assumes that Event Producers and Event Handlers are designed to work together seamlessly, with a clear understanding of the events and actions involved. It also assumes that the Trigger Mechanisms are reliable and efficient.

### 6.3 Invariants
The invariants of the standard model include the requirement for events to be processed in a timely and consistent manner, and for the automation process to be transparent and auditable.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deviations from the standard model must be explicitly documented and justified.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Pattern A: Event-Driven Architecture
- **Intent:** To create a scalable and flexible architecture that can respond to changing system conditions
- **Context:** When the system requires real-time responses to events, and the events are generated by multiple sources
- **Tradeoffs:** Increased complexity, potential for event overload, but improved scalability and flexibility

## 8. Anti-Patterns

> [!WARNING]
> These anti-patterns frequently lead to correctness, maintainability, or scalability issues.

### Anti-Pattern A: Tight Coupling
- **Description:** Event Producers and Event Handlers are tightly coupled, making it difficult to modify or replace either component without affecting the other
- **Failure Mode:** The system becomes brittle and prone to errors, as changes to one component can have unintended consequences on the other
- **Common Causes:** Lack of planning, inadequate design, or insufficient testing

## 9. Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions

Edge cases and boundary conditions in Automated Event Based Triggers include scenarios where events are generated at a high frequency, or where the system is under heavy load. These scenarios can challenge the standard model and require special consideration to ensure correct and efficient event processing.

> [!CAUTION]
> Edge cases are often under-documented and a common source of incorrect assumptions.
