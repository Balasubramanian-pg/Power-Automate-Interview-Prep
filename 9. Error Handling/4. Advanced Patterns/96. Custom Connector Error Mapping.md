# 96. Custom Connector Error Mapping

Canonical documentation for 96. Custom Connector Error Mapping. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 96. Custom Connector Error Mapping exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Custom Connector Error Mapping is to provide a standardized approach to handling and mapping errors that occur during the execution of custom connectors. This is essential in ensuring seamless integration and minimizing disruptions to business processes. The class of problems it addresses includes error handling, debugging, and troubleshooting in custom connector implementations.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Custom Connector Error Mapping involves defining a set of rules and mappings that translate error codes and messages from custom connectors into a standardized format. This enables consistent error handling and reporting across different connector implementations, making it easier to diagnose and resolve issues.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Custom Connector | A bespoke integration component that enables communication between systems or applications. |
| Error Mapping | The process of translating error codes and messages from a custom connector into a standardized format. |
| Error Code | A unique identifier assigned to a specific error or exception. |
| Standardized Format | A predefined format for representing error codes and messages, ensuring consistency across different connector implementations. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Custom Connector Error Mapping include:
* Error code standardization: Defining a set of standardized error codes that can be used across different connector implementations.
* Error message mapping: Translating error messages from custom connectors into a standardized format.
* Error handling: Implementing mechanisms to handle and process errors in a consistent and reliable manner.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Custom Connector Error Mapping involves the following components:
* Error Code Repository: A centralized repository that stores standardized error codes and their corresponding descriptions.
* Error Mapping Engine: A component that translates error codes and messages from custom connectors into the standardized format.
* Error Handling Framework: A framework that provides a set of APIs and interfaces for handling and processing errors in a consistent manner.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Custom Connector Error Mapping include:
* Using a centralized error code repository to store and manage standardized error codes.
* Implementing error mapping engines that can translate error codes and messages from custom connectors into the standardized format.
* Using error handling frameworks to provide a consistent and reliable mechanism for handling and processing errors.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Custom Connector Error Mapping include:
* Using proprietary or non-standardized error codes and messages.
* Implementing error handling mechanisms that are specific to individual connector implementations.
* Failing to provide adequate documentation and support for error handling and debugging.
