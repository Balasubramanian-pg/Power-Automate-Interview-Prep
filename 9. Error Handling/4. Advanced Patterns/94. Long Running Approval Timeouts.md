> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 94. Long Running Approval Timeouts exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 94. Long Running Approval Timeouts is to address the issue of prolonged approval processes that can cause delays, inefficiencies, and frustration in various business and organizational contexts. This problem space encompasses scenarios where approvals are required for transactions, requests, or decisions, but the approval process takes an excessively long time, leading to missed deadlines, lost opportunities, and decreased productivity.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of 94. Long Running Approval Timeouts involves understanding the approval process as a critical component of business operations, where timely approvals are essential for maintaining efficiency and effectiveness. This concept recognizes that approval processes can be complex, involving multiple stakeholders, and that delays can have significant consequences. The mental model includes identifying the root causes of long running approval timeouts, such as inadequate workflows, insufficient resources, or lack of clear guidelines, and implementing strategies to mitigate these issues.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Approval Timeout | The maximum allowed time for an approval process to complete before it is considered failed or expired. |
| Long Running Approval | An approval process that takes an excessively long time to complete, often causing delays or inefficiencies. |
| Approval Workflow | A series of steps or tasks that must be completed to obtain approval for a transaction, request, or decision. |
| Stakeholder | An individual or group with an interest or concern in the approval process, such as approvers, requesters, or decision-makers. |
| Service Level Agreement (SLA) | A formal agreement that defines the expected service quality, including approval timelines, between stakeholders. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 94. Long Running Approval Timeouts include:
* **Approval Process Optimization**: Streamlining approval workflows to reduce processing times and increase efficiency.
* **Timeout Configuration**: Setting optimal approval timeouts to balance the need for timely approvals with the risk of premature timeouts.
* **Stakeholder Management**: Identifying and engaging stakeholders to ensure that their needs and expectations are met throughout the approval process.
* **SLA Management**: Establishing and managing SLAs to define expected approval timelines and service quality.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for addressing 94. Long Running Approval Timeouts involves:
1. **Identifying Bottlenecks**: Analyzing the approval process to identify areas where delays occur.
2. **Streamlining Workflows**: Implementing changes to simplify and accelerate the approval workflow.
3. **Setting Optimal Timeouts**: Configuring approval timeouts to balance efficiency with the risk of premature timeouts.
4. **Monitoring and Reporting**: Tracking approval process performance and providing regular reports to stakeholders.

## 6. Common Patterns
