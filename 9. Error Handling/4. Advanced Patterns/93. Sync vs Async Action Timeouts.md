Canonical documentation for 93. Sync vs Async Action Timeouts. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 93. Sync vs Async Action Timeouts exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of understanding Sync vs Async Action Timeouts is to effectively manage and handle timeouts in various programming scenarios, ensuring that applications remain responsive, efficient, and reliable. This topic addresses the class of problems related to synchronous and asynchronous action timeouts, including issues such as deadlock, starvation, and unresponsiveness.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of Sync vs Async Action Timeouts revolves around the idea that synchronous actions block the execution of the program until the action is completed, whereas asynchronous actions allow the program to continue executing without waiting for the action to finish. Timeouts are used to prevent infinite waits and ensure that the program remains responsive.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Synchronous Action | An action that blocks the execution of the program until it is completed. |
| Asynchronous Action | An action that allows the program to continue executing without waiting for the action to finish. |
| Timeout | A specified period of time after which an action is considered failed or incomplete. |
| Deadline | A specific point in time by which an action must be completed. |
| Exponential Backoff | A strategy for handling timeouts and retries by increasing the delay between attempts. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Sync vs Async Action Timeouts include understanding the differences between synchronous and asynchronous actions, the importance of timeouts in preventing infinite waits, and the use of deadlines to ensure timely completion of actions. Additionally, concepts such as exponential backoff and retry mechanisms are crucial in handling timeouts and ensuring reliable operation.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for handling Sync vs Async Action Timeouts involves using asynchronous actions with timeouts to prevent blocking and ensure responsiveness. This model also recommends using exponential backoff and retry mechanisms to handle timeouts and minimize the impact of failures.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for handling Sync vs Async Action Timeouts include:
* Using asynchronous actions with timeouts to prevent blocking
* Implementing exponential backoff and retry mechanisms to handle timeouts
* Using deadlines to ensure timely completion of actions
* Monitoring and logging timeout events to identify and resolve issues

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for handling Sync vs Async Action Timeouts include:
* Using synchronous actions for long-running operations, leading to blocking and unresponsiveness
* Failing to implement timeouts, leading to infinite waits and deadlock
* Using fixed delays instead of exponential backoff, leading to inefficient retry mechanisms
* Ignoring or failing to log timeout events, leading to unresolved issues and reliability problems
