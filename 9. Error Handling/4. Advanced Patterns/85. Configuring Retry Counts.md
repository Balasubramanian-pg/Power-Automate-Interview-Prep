# 85. Configuring Retry Counts

Canonical documentation for 85. Configuring Retry Counts. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 85. Configuring Retry Counts exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of configuring retry counts is to provide a mechanism for handling transient failures in systems, allowing for automatic retries of failed operations to improve overall system reliability and availability. This addresses the problem of intermittent errors, such as network connectivity issues or temporary resource unavailability, which can cause system failures or data inconsistencies.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Configuring retry counts involves setting a threshold for the number of times a system will attempt to retry a failed operation before considering it a permanent failure. This threshold is typically based on factors such as the type of operation, the expected failure rate, and the desired level of system availability.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Retry Count | The number of times a system will attempt to retry a failed operation. |
| Retry Interval | The time delay between retry attempts. |
| Retry Policy | A set of rules governing retry behavior, including retry count, interval, and backoff strategy. |
| Backoff Strategy | A algorithm for increasing the retry interval after each failure, to prevent overwhelming the system with repeated attempts. |
| Exponential Backoff | A backoff strategy in which the retry interval increases exponentially after each failure. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of configuring retry counts include:
* **Retry count**: The maximum number of times a system will attempt to retry a failed operation.
* **Retry interval**: The time delay between retry attempts, which can be fixed or variable.
* **Backoff strategy**: An algorithm for increasing the retry interval after each failure, to prevent overwhelming the system with repeated attempts.
* **Retry policy**: A set of rules governing retry behavior, including retry count, interval, and backoff strategy.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for configuring retry counts involves:
1. Setting a retry count based on the expected failure rate and desired level of system availability.
2. Implementing a backoff strategy, such as exponential backoff, to prevent overwhelming the system with repeated attempts.
3. Configuring a retry interval, which can be fixed or variable, to balance between retry frequency and system load.
4. Defining a retry policy that governs retry behavior, including retry count, interval, and backoff strategy.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for configuring retry counts include:
* **Linear retry**: A fixed retry interval, with a constant delay between attempts.
* **Exponential retry**: An exponential backoff strategy, with increasing delay between attempts.
* **Circuit breaker**: A pattern that detects when a system is not responding and prevents further requests until it becomes available again.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for configuring retry counts include:
* **Infinite retry**: Allowing a system to retry indefinitely, which can lead to resource exhaustion and system instability.
* **Zero retry**: Not implementing any retry mechanism, which can lead to system failures and data inconsistencies.
* **Fixed retry interval**: Using a fixed retry interval without considering the system load and failure rate, which can lead to overwhelming the system with repeated attempts.
