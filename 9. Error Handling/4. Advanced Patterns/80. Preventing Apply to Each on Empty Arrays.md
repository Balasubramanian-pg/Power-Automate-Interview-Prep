# 80. Preventing Apply to Each on Empty Arrays

Canonical documentation for 80. Preventing Apply to Each on Empty Arrays. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 80. Preventing Apply to Each on Empty Arrays exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of preventing apply to each on empty arrays is to avoid unnecessary iterations, potential errors, and performance issues that can arise when attempting to apply an operation to each element of an empty array. This problem space is relevant in various programming contexts, including data processing, algorithm design, and software development, where arrays or collections are frequently used to store and manipulate data.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of preventing apply to each on empty arrays involves understanding the implications of iterating over an empty array and the measures that can be taken to avoid such iterations. This includes checking for empty arrays before applying operations, using conditional statements to handle empty arrays, and designing algorithms that can gracefully handle empty input arrays.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Empty Array | An array that contains no elements. |
| Apply to Each | An operation that is applied to each element of an array. |
| Iteration | The process of going through each element of an array. |
| Null or Undefined | A value that represents the absence of any object value. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of preventing apply to each on empty arrays include:
- **Array Initialization**: Ensuring that arrays are properly initialized before use.
- **Empty Array Checks**: Implementing checks to determine if an array is empty before attempting to apply operations.
- **Conditional Statements**: Using if-else statements or similar constructs to handle the case where an array is empty.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing try-catch blocks or error handling mechanisms to catch and manage errors that may occur when dealing with empty arrays.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for preventing apply to each on empty arrays involves a simple check before the iteration process:
```javascript
if (array.length > 0) {
    array.forEach(element => {
        // Apply operation to each element
    });
} else {
    // Handle the case where the array is empty
}
```
This model ensures that the iteration process is only initiated if the array is not empty, thus preventing unnecessary iterations and potential errors.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for preventing apply to each on empty arrays include:
- **Explicit Empty Checks**: Before iterating over an array, explicitly check if it is empty.
- **Using Optional Chaining**: In languages that support it, using optional chaining (`?.`) to safely navigate through potentially null or undefined values, including empty arrays.
- **Default Values**: Providing default values or behaviors when dealing with empty arrays to ensure the program remains stable and functional.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for preventing apply to each on empty arrays include:
- **Ignoring Empty Arrays**: Failing to check for empty arrays before applying operations, which can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.
- **Assuming Non-Empty Arrays**: Assuming that arrays will always contain elements, without implementing checks for empty arrays.
- **Overly Complex Checks**: Implementing overly complex or inefficient checks for empty arrays, which can negatively impact performance.
