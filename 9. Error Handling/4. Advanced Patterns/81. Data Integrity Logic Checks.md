# 81. Data Integrity Logic Checks

Canonical documentation for 81. Data Integrity Logic Checks. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 81. Data Integrity Logic Checks exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of Data Integrity Logic Checks is to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data within an organization's systems. This is crucial in preventing data corruption, inconsistencies, and errors that can have significant consequences, such as financial losses, reputational damage, or compromised decision-making. The class of problems addressed by Data Integrity Logic Checks includes data inconsistencies, invalid data, and data corruption, which can arise from various sources, including human error, system failures, or malicious activities.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Data Integrity Logic Checks involve a set of rules, constraints, and validation processes that are applied to data to ensure its integrity. This includes checks for data format, range, and consistency, as well as more complex rules that involve relationships between different data elements. The conceptual model of Data Integrity Logic Checks involves a layered approach, with multiple levels of checks and validations that are applied to data as it is entered, processed, and stored.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Data Integrity | The state of data being accurate, complete, and consistent |
| Logic Check | A validation process that applies a set of rules and constraints to data |
| Validation Rule | A specific condition or constraint that is applied to data to ensure its integrity |
| Data Constraint | A limitation or restriction on the values that can be entered for a particular data element |
| Data Consistency | The state of data being consistent across different systems, applications, or datasets |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Data Integrity Logic Checks include:
* Data validation: The process of checking data against a set of rules and constraints to ensure its integrity
* Data verification: The process of confirming the accuracy and completeness of data
* Data normalization: The process of transforming data into a standard format to ensure consistency
* Data quality metrics: The measurement of data quality using metrics such as accuracy, completeness, and consistency

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Data Integrity Logic Checks involves a multi-layered approach, with the following components:
* Data entry validation: Checks are applied to data as it is entered to ensure its format, range, and consistency
* Data processing validation: Checks are applied to data as it is processed to ensure its integrity and consistency
* Data storage validation: Checks are applied to data as it is stored to ensure its integrity and consistency
* Data retrieval validation: Checks are applied to data as it is retrieved to ensure its integrity and consistency

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Data Integrity Logic Checks include:
* Using data validation frameworks and libraries to simplify the development and implementation of data integrity checks
* Implementing data integrity checks at multiple layers, including data entry, processing, storage, and retrieval
* Using data quality metrics to measure the effectiveness of data integrity checks and identify areas for improvement

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Data Integrity Logic Checks include:
* Implementing data integrity checks only at the data entry layer, neglecting the need for checks at other layers
* Using overly complex or rigid data validation rules that can lead to false positives or false negatives
* Failing to regularly review and update data integrity checks to ensure they remain effective and relevant
