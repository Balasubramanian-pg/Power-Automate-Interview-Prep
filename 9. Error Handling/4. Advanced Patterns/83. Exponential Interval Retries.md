## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 83. Exponential Interval Retries exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Exponential Interval Retries is a strategy used to handle failed operations or requests in a system, aiming to minimize the impact of failures and improve overall system resilience. It addresses the problem of repeated failures in a system, where a simple retry mechanism can lead to cascading failures or increased latency. By implementing exponential backoff with jitter, systems can reduce the likelihood of simultaneous retries, thereby decreasing the load on the system and improving the overall success rate of operations.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Exponential Interval Retries mechanism involves retrying a failed operation after a certain delay, with the delay increasing exponentially after each failure. This approach helps prevent a surge of retries from overwhelming the system. The addition of jitter, or randomness, to the delay helps prevent the "thundering herd" problem, where multiple clients retry at the same time, causing another wave of failures.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Exponential Backoff | A strategy where the delay between retries increases exponentially after each failure. |
| Jitter | The introduction of randomness in the delay before a retry to prevent simultaneous retries. |
| Retry | An attempt to repeat a failed operation. |
| Exponential Interval | The time gap between retries, which increases exponentially. |
| Base Delay | The initial delay before the first retry. |
| Maximum Delay | The upper limit of the delay between retries to prevent extremely long wait times. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Exponential Interval Retries include:
- **Exponential Increase**: The delay between retries increases exponentially to reduce the load on the system after a failure.
- **Randomization (Jitter)**: Introducing randomness in the delay helps distribute the retries over time, preventing a large number of clients from retrying simultaneously.
- **Limiting Retries**: Implementing a maximum number of retries or a maximum delay to prevent infinite loops or excessively long wait times.
- **Backoff Strategy**: The specific algorithm used to calculate the delay between retries, which can vary but typically involves exponential increase and jitter.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Exponential Interval Retries involves:
1. **Initial Retry**: After the first failure, wait for a base delay before retrying.
2. **Exponential Backoff**: For each subsequent failure, calculate the delay as a multiple (e.g., 2 times) of the previous delay, up to a maximum delay.
3. **Introducing Jitter**: Randomly modify the calculated delay by a certain percentage to introduce jitter.
4. **Maximum Attempts**: Limit the number of retries to prevent infinite loops.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns include:
- **Linear vs. Exponential Backoff**: While linear backoff is simpler, exponential backoff is more effective in distributed systems to prevent overwhelming the system with retries.
- **Fixed vs. Random Jitter**: Fixed jitter can be predictable and less effective; random jitter is generally preferred for its unpredictability.
- **Combining with Circuit Breakers**: Using Exponential Interval Retries in conjunction with circuit breakers to detect when a service is not responding and prevent further requests.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns include:
- **Immediate Retries**: Retrying immediately without any delay, which can lead to a surge in requests and overwhelm the system.
- **Linear Backoff without Jitter**: Using a linear increase in delay without introducing any randomness, which can still lead to synchronized retries.
- **Infinite Retries**: Allowing a process to retry indefinitely, which can lead to resource exhaustion and prolonged system unavailability.
