# 79. Managing Not Found Logic Paths

Canonical documentation for 79. Managing Not Found Logic Paths. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 79. Managing Not Found Logic Paths exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of managing not found logic paths is to handle situations where a requested resource, data, or information is not available. This can occur in various contexts, such as web development, database queries, or file systems. The problem space includes scenarios where an application or system needs to respond to a "not found" condition, providing a suitable error message, redirecting to an alternative resource, or offering suggestions for alternative actions.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Managing not found logic paths involves a set of strategies and techniques for detecting and responding to "not found" conditions. This includes designing error handling mechanisms, implementing redirect protocols, and developing user-friendly interfaces for communicating errors. The conceptual overview encompasses the identification of potential not found scenarios, the development of response mechanisms, and the integration of these mechanisms into the overall system architecture.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Not Found Condition | A situation where a requested resource, data, or information is not available. |
| Error Handling | The process of detecting and responding to errors, including not found conditions. |
| Redirect Protocol | A set of rules and procedures for redirecting a user or system to an alternative resource. |
| Error Message | A message communicated to the user or system indicating that a not found condition has occurred. |
| Alternative Resource | A substitute resource, data, or information provided when the original request cannot be fulfilled. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of managing not found logic paths include:
* **Error detection**: Identifying when a not found condition has occurred.
* **Error response**: Providing a suitable response to the not found condition, such as an error message or redirect.
* **Redirect mechanisms**: Implementing protocols for redirecting to alternative resources.
* **User experience**: Designing interfaces and messages that communicate errors in a user-friendly manner.
* **System architecture**: Integrating not found logic paths into the overall system design.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for managing not found logic paths involves a layered approach:
1. **Detection**: Identify the not found condition.
2. **Analysis**: Determine the cause and context of the not found condition.
3. **Response**: Provide a suitable response, such as an error message or redirect.
4. **Redirect**: Implement redirect mechanisms to alternative resources, if applicable.
5. **Logging**: Record the not found condition for future analysis and improvement.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for managing not found logic paths include:
* **404 error pages**: Customized error pages for web applications.
* **Redirect to homepage**: Redirecting users to the application homepage when a not found condition occurs.
* **Search suggestions**: Providing search suggestions or alternative resources when a not found condition occurs.
* **Error logging**: Logging not found conditions for future analysis and improvement.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for managing not found logic paths include:
* **Generic error messages**: Using generic, uninformative error messages that do not provide context or assistance.
* **Inconsistent redirects**: Implementing inconsistent or unpredictable redirect mechanisms.
* **Ignoring not found conditions**: Failing to detect or respond to not found conditions, leading to poor user experience.
