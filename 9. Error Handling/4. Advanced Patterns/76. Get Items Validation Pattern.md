Canonical documentation for 76. Get Items Validation Pattern. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 76. Get Items Validation Pattern exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The 76. Get Items Validation Pattern exists to address the need for validating and retrieving items from a collection or data source. This pattern is essential in various applications, such as data processing, filtering, and sorting, where ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the retrieved items is crucial. The class of problems it addresses includes handling invalid or missing data, preventing errors, and improving overall system reliability.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The 76. Get Items Validation Pattern involves a series of steps that enable the validation and retrieval of items from a data source. This pattern typically includes data source connection, query formulation, item retrieval, validation, and error handling. The pattern's primary goal is to ensure that the retrieved items meet specific criteria, such as data type, format, or range, to prevent errors and inconsistencies in downstream processing.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Data Source | A repository of data, such as a database, file, or API, that provides access to the items to be retrieved and validated. |
| Item | A single unit of data, such as a record, object, or value, that is retrieved from the data source and validated. |
| Validation Rule | A set of criteria or constraints that define the requirements for an item to be considered valid. |
| Error Handling | The process of detecting, reporting, and recovering from errors that occur during the item retrieval and validation process. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the 76. Get Items Validation Pattern include:
* **Data Source Connection**: Establishing a connection to the data source to access the items.
* **Query Formulation**: Creating a query or request to retrieve the desired items from the data source.
* **Item Retrieval**: Fetching the items from the data source based on the query.
* **Validation**: Checking the retrieved items against the validation rules to ensure they meet the required criteria.
* **Error Handling**: Detecting and handling errors that occur during the item retrieval and validation process.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the 76. Get Items Validation Pattern involves the following steps:
1. Connect to the data source.
2. Formulate a query to retrieve the desired items.
3. Retrieve the items from the data source.
4. Validate the retrieved items against the validation rules.
5. Handle any errors that occur during the process.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns that use the 76. Get Items Validation Pattern include:
* **Data Filtering**: Retrieving a subset of items from a data source based on specific criteria.
* **Data Sorting**: Arranging items in a specific order based on one or more attributes.
* **Data Aggregation**: Combining multiple items into a single item or value.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns to avoid when using the 76. Get Items Validation Pattern include:
* **Invalid Assumptions**: Assuming that the data source or items will always be available or valid.
* **Inadequate Error Handling**: Failing to detect or handle errors that occur during the item retrieval and validation process.
* **Overly Complex Validation**: Using overly complex or convoluted validation rules that are difficult to maintain or understand.
