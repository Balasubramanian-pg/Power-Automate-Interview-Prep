# 97. Parsing API Error JSON

Canonical documentation for 97. Parsing API Error JSON. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 97. Parsing API Error JSON exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of parsing API error JSON is to handle and interpret error responses from Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in a standardized and efficient manner. This addresses the problem space of error handling in API interactions, where errors can occur due to various reasons such as invalid requests, server-side issues, or network problems. Effective parsing of API error JSON enables developers to diagnose issues, provide meaningful error messages, and implement robust error handling mechanisms.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Parsing API error JSON involves interpreting the structure and content of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data returned by an API in response to an error. This process typically includes identifying the error type, severity, and any additional information provided by the API, such as error codes, messages, or troubleshooting hints. The conceptual overview encompasses understanding the JSON format, recognizing common error patterns, and applying this knowledge to develop resilient and user-friendly applications.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| API | Application Programming Interface: a set of defined rules that enable different applications, systems, or services to communicate with each other. |
| JSON | JavaScript Object Notation: a lightweight, text-based data interchange format used for exchanging data between web servers, web applications, and mobile apps. |
| Error Response | A response from an API indicating that an error has occurred, typically including information about the error. |
| Error Handling | The process of detecting, analyzing, and responding to errors that occur during the execution of a program or interaction with an API. |
| Parsing | The process of analyzing a string of data (such as JSON) to identify its component parts and understand its structure and content. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of parsing API error JSON include understanding the JSON data format, recognizing common error response structures, and implementing effective error handling strategies. This involves being able to parse JSON data to extract relevant error information, such as error codes, messages, and additional details. It also requires an understanding of how to handle different types of errors appropriately, including logging, displaying user-friendly error messages, and potentially retrying failed operations.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for parsing API error JSON typically involves the following steps:
1. **Receiving the Error Response**: The API returns a JSON response indicating an error.
2. **Parsing the JSON Data**: The application parses the JSON data to extract error information.
3. **Identifying the Error Type**: The application determines the type of error (e.g., validation error, server error).
4. **Handling the Error**: Based on the error type and severity, the application implements appropriate error handling, such as logging, displaying an error message, or retrying the operation.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in parsing API error JSON include:
- **Centralized Error Handling**: Implementing a centralized error handling mechanism to manage errors across the application.
- **Error Logging**: Logging error details for diagnostic and debugging purposes.
- **User-Friendly Error Messages**: Displaying error messages that are understandable and helpful to the user.
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Implementing retry mechanisms for transient errors, such as network issues.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in parsing API error JSON include:
- **Ignoring Errors**: Failing to handle or log errors, which can lead to undiagnosed issues and poor user experience.
- **Overly Generic Error Messages**: Displaying generic error messages that do not provide useful information to the user.
- **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Handling errors inconsistently across the application, leading to confusion and maintenance issues.
