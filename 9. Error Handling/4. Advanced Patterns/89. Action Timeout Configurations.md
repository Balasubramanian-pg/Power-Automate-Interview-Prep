# 89. Action Timeout Configurations

Canonical documentation for 89. Action Timeout Configurations. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 89. Action Timeout Configurations exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of Action Timeout Configurations is to provide a standardized mechanism for managing timeouts in distributed systems, ensuring that actions are executed within a specified time frame to prevent indefinite waits and resource starvation. This configuration addresses the problem of unpredictable system behavior, errors, and performance degradation caused by unmanaged timeouts.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Action Timeout Configurations involve setting time limits for specific actions or operations within a system, allowing for the detection of and recovery from timeouts, and enabling the implementation of retry mechanisms, failovers, or other error-handling strategies. This conceptual model encompasses the configuration, monitoring, and management of timeouts to ensure reliable and efficient system operation.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Action | A specific task or operation performed by a system or component. |
| Timeout | The maximum time allowed for an action to complete before it is considered failed or unresponsive. |
| Timeout Configuration | The process of setting and managing timeout values for actions within a system. |
| Retry Mechanism | A strategy for re-executing a failed action to achieve successful completion. |
| Failover | The automatic switching to a redundant or backup system or component in the event of a failure. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Action Timeout Configurations include:
* **Timeout detection**: Identifying when an action has exceeded its allocated time limit.
* **Timeout handling**: Implementing strategies for recovering from timeouts, such as retrying the action or switching to a failover system.
* **Configuration management**: Defining, storing, and updating timeout values and associated settings.
* **Monitoring and logging**: Tracking and recording timeout events to facilitate debugging and performance optimization.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Action Timeout Configurations typically involves:
1. **Timeout value definition**: Specifying the maximum time allowed for each action.
2. **Timeout detection mechanism**: Implementing a mechanism to detect when an action has timed out.
3. **Retry or failover strategy**: Defining a strategy for handling timeouts, such as retrying the action or switching to a failover system.
4. **Configuration storage**: Storing timeout values and associated settings in a centralized configuration repository.
5. **Monitoring and logging**: Integrating timeout event monitoring and logging to facilitate debugging and performance optimization.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Action Timeout Configurations include:
* **Exponential backoff**: Gradually increasing the time between retries to prevent overwhelming the system.
* **Circuit breakers**: Detecting when a system is experiencing repeated failures and preventing further requests until it recovers.
* **Timeout hierarchies**: Establishing a hierarchy of timeout values to manage complex systems with multiple dependencies.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Action Timeout Configurations include:
* **Hardcoded timeout values**: Using fixed, non-configurable timeout values that may not be suitable for all scenarios.
* **Insufficient monitoring**: Failing to track and log timeout events, making it difficult to diagnose and optimize system performance.
* **Inconsistent retry strategies**: Implementing inconsistent or ad-hoc retry mechanisms that can lead to unpredictable system behavior.
