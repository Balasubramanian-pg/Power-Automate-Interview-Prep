Canonical documentation for 84. Fixed Interval Retries. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 84. Fixed Interval Retries exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of Fixed Interval Retries is to provide a reliable and efficient mechanism for handling transient failures in distributed systems, networks, and other error-prone environments. This approach addresses the class of problems related to temporary failures, such as network partitions, server overload, or resource unavailability, by allowing systems to automatically retry failed operations after a fixed time interval.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Fixed Interval Retries can be conceptualized as a simple, yet effective, retry mechanism that operates on a fixed-time interval basis. When a failure occurs, the system waits for a predetermined amount of time before retrying the operation. This process continues until the operation is successful or a maximum number of retries is reached.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Retry Interval | The fixed time interval between retry attempts |
| Maximum Retries | The maximum number of retry attempts allowed |
| Retry Policy | The set of rules governing the retry mechanism, including the retry interval and maximum retries |
| Transient Failure | A temporary failure that can be recovered from by retrying the operation |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Fixed Interval Retries include:
* **Retry Interval**: The time interval between retry attempts, which should be carefully chosen to balance between minimizing latency and avoiding overwhelming the system with repeated requests.
* **Maximum Retries**: The maximum number of retry attempts allowed, which helps prevent infinite loops and reduces the risk of cascading failures.
* **Exponential Backoff**: A variation of Fixed Interval Retries where the retry interval increases exponentially after each failure, helping to prevent overwhelming the system with repeated requests.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Fixed Interval Retries involves:
1. Detecting a failure or error condition
2. Waiting for the retry interval to elapse
3. Retrying the operation
4. Repeating steps 2-3 until the operation is successful or the maximum number of retries is reached

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Fixed Interval Retries include:
* **Linear Retry**: Retrying the operation at fixed intervals, with no increase in the interval between retries.
* **Exponential Retry**: Retrying the operation with an exponentially increasing interval between retries.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Fixed Interval Retries include:
* **Infinite Retries**: Allowing the system to retry indefinitely, which can lead to cascading failures and system overload.
* **Insufficient Retry Interval**: Using a retry interval that is too short, which can cause the system to become overwhelmed with repeated requests.
