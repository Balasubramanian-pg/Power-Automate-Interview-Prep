> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 88. Charging Credit Cards: Retry Risks exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Charging Credit Cards: Retry Risks is to mitigate the risks associated with retrying failed credit card transactions. This is a critical aspect of online payment processing, as it directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction. The problem space includes handling declined transactions, managing retry attempts, and minimizing the risk of fraudulent activity.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Charging Credit Cards: Retry Risks involves a complex interplay between payment gateways, merchant accounts, and customer credit cards. The process begins with an initial transaction attempt, which may be declined due to insufficient funds, expired cards, or other issues. If a decline occurs, the system may initiate a retry sequence, which involves resubmitting the transaction request after a predetermined delay. This process requires careful management to avoid overwhelming the payment gateway, incurring unnecessary fees, or triggering fraudulent activity alerts.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions

| Retry Delay | The time interval between retry attempts |
| Payment Gateway | A service that facilitates communication between merchants and credit card networks |
| Merchant Account | A type of bank account that allows businesses to accept credit card payments |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Charging Credit Cards: Retry Risks include:
* **Retry Strategy**: The approach used to determine when and how to retry declined transactions
* **Decline Reason Analysis**: The process of evaluating decline reasons to inform retry decisions
* **Risk Assessment**: The evaluation of potential risks associated with retrying transactions, such as fraud or chargebacks
* **Payment Gateway Optimization**: The process of configuring payment gateways to minimize declines and optimize retry attempts

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Charging Credit Cards: Retry Risks involves a combination of automated retry attempts and manual review. The recommended approach includes:
* **Initial Retry Attempt**: A single retry attempt after a short delay (e.g., 1-2 hours)
* **Subsequent Retry Attempts**: Additional retry attempts after increasingly longer delays (e.g., 4-6 hours, 12-24 hours)
* **Manual Review**: Human evaluation of declined transactions to determine the best course of action

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Charging Credit Cards: Retry Risks include:
* **Exponential Backoff**: Increasing the delay between retry attempts to avoid overwhelming the payment gateway
* **Decline Reason-Based Retry**: Adjusting the retry strategy based on the decline reason (e.g., retrying more aggressively for declines due to temporary issues)
* **Customer Notification**: Informing customers of declined transactions and retry attempts to maintain transparency and trust

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Charging Credit Cards: Retry Risks include:
* **Aggressive Retry**: Retrying transactions too frequently, which can lead to payment gateway overload and increased decline rates
* **Insufficient Decline Reason Analysis**: Failing to evaluate decline reasons, resulting in ineffective retry strategies
* **Lack of Customer Notification**: Failing to inform customers of declined transactions and retry attempts, leading to confusion and frustration
