# 95. HTTP Action Failure Handling

Canonical documentation for 95. HTTP Action Failure Handling. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 95. HTTP Action Failure Handling exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of 95. HTTP Action Failure Handling is to provide a standardized approach to handling failures that occur during HTTP actions, ensuring that systems can recover from errors and exceptions in a predictable and reliable manner. This topic addresses the class of problems related to error handling, fault tolerance, and system resilience in HTTP-based applications.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of 95. HTTP Action Failure Handling involves a set of strategies and techniques for detecting, handling, and recovering from failures that occur during HTTP actions. This includes error detection, exception handling, retry mechanisms, and fallback strategies. The model also considers the impact of failures on system performance, security, and user experience.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| HTTP Action | A request or operation sent over the HTTP protocol, such as a GET, POST, or PUT request. |
| Failure | An error or exception that occurs during an HTTP action, resulting in an unsuccessful outcome. |
| Retry | The act of re-attempting an HTTP action that previously failed, often with a delay or backoff strategy. |
| Fallback | A secondary or alternative approach used when an HTTP action fails, such as using a cached response or a default value. |
| Error Handling | The process of detecting, handling, and recovering from errors that occur during HTTP actions. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 95. HTTP Action Failure Handling include:
* **Error detection**: Identifying and recognizing errors that occur during HTTP actions.
* **Exception handling**: Catching and handling exceptions that are raised during HTTP actions.
* **Retry mechanisms**: Implementing retry strategies to re-attempt failed HTTP actions.
* **Fallback strategies**: Providing alternative approaches or default values when HTTP actions fail.
* **System resilience**: Designing systems to withstand and recover from failures, ensuring high availability and reliability.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 95. HTTP Action Failure Handling involves a layered approach, consisting of:
1. **Error detection**: Implementing error detection mechanisms, such as error codes, exception handling, and logging.
2. **Retry mechanisms**: Implementing retry strategies, such as exponential backoff or circuit breakers.
3. **Fallback strategies**: Providing fallback approaches, such as cached responses or default values.
4. **Error handling**: Implementing error handling mechanisms, such as error codes, exception handling, and logging.
5. **System monitoring**: Monitoring system performance and errors to detect and respond to failures.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in 95. HTTP Action Failure Handling include:
* **Retry with exponential backoff**: Retrying failed HTTP actions with increasing delays between attempts.
* **Circuit breakers**: Detecting and preventing cascading failures by temporarily blocking requests to a failing service.
* **Fallback to cached response**: Returning a cached response when an HTTP action fails.
* **Default value fallback**: Returning a default value when an HTTP action fails.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in 95. HTTP Action Failure Handling include:
* **Ignoring errors**: Failing to detect or handle errors, leading to system crashes or unpredictable behavior.
* **Infinite retries**: Retrying failed HTTP actions indefinitely, leading to resource exhaustion or cascading failures.
* **No fallback strategy**: Failing to provide alternative approaches or default values when HTTP actions fail.
