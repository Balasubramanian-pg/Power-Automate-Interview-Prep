Canonical documentation for 92. Failing Fast for Quick Recovery. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 92. Failing Fast for Quick Recovery exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The concept of Failing Fast for Quick Recovery exists to address the need for systems to quickly identify and recover from failures, minimizing downtime and data loss. This approach acknowledges that failures are inevitable and instead of trying to prevent them entirely, it focuses on detecting them early and recovering swiftly. The class of problems it addresses includes system crashes, network failures, and software errors, where prompt recovery is crucial for maintaining system availability and reliability.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Failing Fast for Quick Recovery involves designing systems to fail in a predictable and contained manner, allowing for rapid detection and recovery. This approach requires a mindset shift from trying to prevent all failures to embracing the inevitability of failures and focusing on minimizing their impact. It involves implementing mechanisms for early failure detection, automated recovery processes, and continuous monitoring to ensure system stability and performance.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Failure | An event or condition that causes a system or component to cease functioning as intended. |
| Recovery | The process of restoring a system or component to a functional state after a failure. |
| Downtime | The period during which a system or component is unavailable due to a failure. |
| Resilience | The ability of a system or component to withstand and recover from failures. |
| Fault Tolerance | The ability of a system or component to continue functioning despite the occurrence of a failure. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Failing Fast for Quick Recovery include:
- **Early Failure Detection**: Implementing mechanisms to quickly identify when a failure has occurred.
- **Automated Recovery**: Designing systems to automatically recover from failures without human intervention.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly monitoring system performance and health to detect potential issues before they become incidents.
- **Redundancy**: Implementing redundant components or systems to ensure continued functionality in the event of a failure.
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Designing systems to default to a safe state in the event of a failure, minimizing potential damage.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Failing Fast for Quick Recovery involves a cyclical process of:
1. **Failure Detection**: Identifying when a failure has occurred.
2. **Failure Analysis**: Determining the cause of the failure.
3. **Recovery**: Restoring the system or component to a functional state.
4. **Post-Mortem Analysis**: Reviewing the failure and recovery process to identify areas for improvement.
5. **Implementation of Fixes**: Applying changes to prevent similar failures in the future.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Failing Fast for Quick Recovery include:
- **Circuit Breakers**: Implementing a mechanism to detect when a service is not responding and prevent further requests until it is restored.
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatically retrying failed operations to account for transient failures.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing workload across multiple components to ensure continued functionality if one component fails.
- **Rolling Updates**: Gradually updating components to minimize downtime and reduce the risk of widespread failure.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Failing Fast for Quick Recovery include:
- **Ignoring Failures**: Failing to address or learn from failures, leading to repeated incidents.
- **Over-Engineering**: Implementing overly complex solutions that increase the risk of new failures.
- **Lack of Monitoring**: Not regularly monitoring system performance, leading to delayed detection of failures.
- **Manual Recovery**: Relying on manual processes for recovery, which can be slow and prone to error.
