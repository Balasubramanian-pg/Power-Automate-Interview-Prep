> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 87. When to Disable Retries exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of "When to Disable Retries" is to provide guidance on determining when retry mechanisms should be disabled to prevent unnecessary resource consumption, reduce latency, and improve overall system reliability. This topic addresses the class of problems related to retry storms, cascading failures, and performance degradation caused by excessive retry attempts in distributed systems, networks, and applications.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of "When to Disable Retries" involves understanding the trade-offs between retrying failed operations and accepting failures. It requires considering factors such as error types, retry thresholds, timeout values, and the potential impact of retries on system performance and user experience. This model also involves recognizing the importance of exponential backoff, circuit breakers, and fault tolerance in designing robust and resilient systems.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Retry | An automatic attempt to re-execute a failed operation or request. |
| Retry Threshold | The maximum number of retry attempts allowed before considering the operation failed. |
| Exponential Backoff | A strategy for increasing the delay between retry attempts to prevent overload and reduce the likelihood of cascading failures. |
| Circuit Breaker | A design pattern that detects when a service is not responding and prevents further requests from being sent to it until it becomes available again. |
| Fault Tolerance | The ability of a system to continue operating correctly even when one or more components fail or are experiencing errors. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of "When to Disable Retries" include:
* Understanding the differences between idempotent and non-idempotent operations and how they affect retry strategies.
* Recognizing the importance of distinguishing between transient and permanent errors to determine the appropriate retry approach.
* Implementing exponential backoff and circuit breakers to prevent retry storms and reduce the load on failing systems.
* Monitoring and analyzing system performance to identify areas where retries can be optimized or disabled.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for "When to Disable Retries" involves a combination of the following strategies:
* Implementing retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for idempotent operations.
* Using circuit breakers to detect and prevent cascading failures.
* Disabling retries for non-idempotent operations or when the retry threshold is exceeded.
* Monitoring system performance and adjusting retry strategies based on error rates, latency, and resource utilization.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for "When to Disable Retries" include:
* Retry-with-exponential-backoff: retrying failed operations with increasing delays to prevent overload.
* Circuit-breaker-with-fallback: using circuit breakers to detect failures and falling back to a default or cached response.
* Retry-threshold-with-disable: disabling retries when the threshold is exceeded to prevent cascading failures.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for "When to Disable Retries" include:
* Blindly retrying failed operations without considering the error type or retry threshold.
* Using fixed delays between retry attempts, which can lead to retry storms and overload.
* Failing to implement circuit breakers or fault tolerance mechanisms, making systems more prone to cascading failures.
