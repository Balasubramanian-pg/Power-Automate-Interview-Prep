Canonical documentation for 91. Preventing Premature Timeouts. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 91. Preventing Premature Timeouts exists and the class of problems it addresses.
91. Preventing Premature Timeouts exists to address the issue of premature timeouts in various systems, including network connections, API calls, and other time-sensitive operations. Premature timeouts can lead to errors, data loss, and decreased system reliability. This document provides guidance on preventing premature timeouts, ensuring that systems can handle time-sensitive operations efficiently and effectively.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of 91. Preventing Premature Timeouts involves understanding the factors that contribute to premature timeouts, such as network latency, server overload, and incorrect configuration. It also involves implementing strategies to prevent or mitigate these factors, including adjusting timeout settings, implementing retry mechanisms, and optimizing system performance.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Timeout | A predetermined period of time after which a system or operation is terminated or cancelled if no response or action is received. |
| Premature Timeout | A timeout that occurs before the expected or desired completion of an operation, often due to external factors such as network latency or server overload. |
| Retry Mechanism | A system or process that automatically retries a failed operation, often with a delay or backoff period between attempts. |
| Timeout Setting | A configurable parameter that determines the length of time after which a system or operation is terminated or cancelled if no response or action is received. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 91. Preventing Premature Timeouts include understanding the causes of premature timeouts, identifying the optimal timeout settings for a given system or operation, and implementing effective retry mechanisms. Additionally, it involves monitoring system performance and adjusting timeout settings and retry mechanisms as needed to prevent premature timeouts.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for preventing premature timeouts involves a combination of the following elements:
1. **Timeout setting**: Configurable timeout settings that can be adjusted based on system performance and operational requirements.
2. **Retry mechanism**: Automated retry mechanisms that can detect and recover from premature timeouts.
3. **Exponential backoff**: A strategy for increasing the delay between retry attempts to prevent overwhelming the system.
4. **Monitoring and feedback**: Continuous monitoring of system performance and feedback mechanisms to adjust timeout settings and retry mechanisms as needed.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for preventing premature timeouts include:
* **Linear retry**: A simple retry mechanism that retries a failed operation at fixed intervals.
* **Exponential retry**: A retry mechanism that increases the delay between retry attempts exponentially.
* **Circuit breaker**: A pattern that detects when a system is not responding and prevents further requests until it becomes available again.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for preventing premature timeouts include:
* **Fixed timeout settings**: Using fixed, unconfigurable timeout settings that do not account for changing system performance or operational requirements.
* **Inadequate retry mechanisms**: Implementing retry mechanisms that are insufficient or ineffective, such as retrying too frequently or not at all.
* **Lack of monitoring and feedback**: Failing to monitor system performance and adjust timeout settings and retry mechanisms accordingly.
