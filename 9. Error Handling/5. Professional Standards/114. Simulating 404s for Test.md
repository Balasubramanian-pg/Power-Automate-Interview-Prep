# 114. Simulating 404s for Test

Canonical documentation for 114. Simulating 404s for Test. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 114. Simulating 404s for Test exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of simulating 404s for test is to ensure that web applications and services can handle cases where a requested resource is not found. This is crucial for maintaining user experience, as it allows developers to test and refine error handling mechanisms. The problem space includes scenarios where resources are missing, deleted, or inaccessible, and the application must respond accordingly.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Simulating 404s for test involves creating a controlled environment where a web application or service is presented with a request for a non-existent resource. This can be achieved through various methods, including modifying URL requests, manipulating server configurations, or using specialized testing tools. The goal is to observe and verify the application's behavior in response to the simulated 404 error.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| 404 Error | A standard HTTP error response indicating that a requested resource is not found. |
| Simulated 404 | A test scenario where a 404 error is intentionally triggered to evaluate an application's response. |
| Test Environment | A controlled setup for testing web applications, including simulated 404 scenarios. |
| Error Handling | Mechanisms and processes used by an application to respond to and manage errors, such as 404 errors. |
| Resource | Any entity or component that can be requested or accessed within a web application, such as pages, images, or data. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of simulating 404s for test include understanding HTTP error responses, creating a test environment, and evaluating error handling mechanisms. Developers must also consider the types of resources that may be requested and the potential impact of 404 errors on user experience.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for simulating 404s for test involves the following steps:
1. Identify the resources to be tested.
2. Create a test environment that can simulate 404 errors.
3. Trigger the simulated 404 error.
4. Evaluate the application's response and error handling mechanisms.
5. Refine and iterate on the testing process as needed.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for simulating 404s for test include:
* Using URL manipulation to request non-existent resources.
* Configuring server settings to return 404 errors for specific requests.
* Utilizing testing frameworks and tools to automate the simulation process.
* Incorporating simulated 404 tests into larger testing suites and workflows.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for simulating 404s for test include:
* Failing to properly isolate test environments, leading to unintended effects on production systems.
* Insufficiently testing error handling mechanisms, resulting in inadequate or unhandled 404 errors.
* Neglecting to consider the impact of 404 errors on user experience and application usability.
* Over-reliance on manual testing methods, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error.
