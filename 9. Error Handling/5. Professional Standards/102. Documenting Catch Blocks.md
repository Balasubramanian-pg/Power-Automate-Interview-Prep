Canonical documentation for 102. Documenting Catch Blocks. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 102. Documenting Catch Blocks exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of documenting catch blocks is to provide a clear understanding of how exceptions are handled within a system, ensuring that developers can effectively manage and resolve errors. This documentation addresses the problem of inadequate error handling, which can lead to system crashes, data corruption, and security vulnerabilities.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Documenting catch blocks involves capturing the essential information about exception handling, including the type of exception, the cause of the exception, and the actions taken to recover from the exception. This information is crucial for maintaining robust and reliable systems.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Catch Block | A code segment that handles exceptions thrown by a try block. |
| Exception | An event that occurs during the execution of a program, such as an error or an unexpected condition. |
| Try Block | A code segment that may throw exceptions, which are then handled by a corresponding catch block. |
| Error Handling | The process of detecting, analyzing, and responding to exceptions or errors that occur during system execution. |
| Exception Propagation | The process of passing an exception from one part of a system to another, allowing it to be handled at a higher level. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of documenting catch blocks include:
* Identifying the type of exception being handled
* Describing the cause of the exception
* Outlining the actions taken to recover from the exception
* Providing information about exception propagation and handling

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for documenting catch blocks involves:
1. Clearly identifying the catch block and its corresponding try block
2. Providing a concise description of the exception being handled
3. Outlining the steps taken to recover from the exception
4. Including information about exception propagation and handling

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for documenting catch blocks include:
* Using a standard template for catch block documentation
* Including a description of the exception and its cause
* Providing a step-by-step guide for recovering from the exception
* Using code snippets to illustrate exception handling

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for documenting catch blocks include:
* Failing to provide clear and concise descriptions of exceptions
* Omitting information about exception propagation and handling
* Using generic or vague descriptions of exceptions
* Neglecting to update catch block documentation when code changes occur
