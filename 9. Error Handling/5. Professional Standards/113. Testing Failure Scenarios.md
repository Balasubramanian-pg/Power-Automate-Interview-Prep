Canonical documentation for 113. Testing Failure Scenarios. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 113. Testing Failure Scenarios exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of testing failure scenarios is to ensure that a system can handle and recover from unexpected failures, errors, or exceptions. This is crucial in maintaining the reliability, availability, and overall quality of the system. Testing failure scenarios addresses the class of problems related to system robustness, fault tolerance, and error handling. By simulating various failure scenarios, developers can identify potential weaknesses, design mitigation strategies, and implement effective recovery mechanisms.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Testing failure scenarios involves a systematic approach to identifying, analyzing, and mitigating potential failures in a system. This includes understanding the system's architecture, identifying critical components, and simulating various failure scenarios to test the system's response. The conceptual overview of testing failure scenarios encompasses the following key aspects:
- Failure mode analysis: identifying potential failure modes and their effects on the system
- Fault injection: simulating failures or errors to test the system's response
- Error handling: designing and implementing effective error handling mechanisms
- Recovery strategies: developing strategies for recovering from failures or errors

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Failure Scenario | A specific situation or condition that can cause a system to fail or malfunction |
| Fault Tolerance | The ability of a system to continue operating correctly even when one or more components fail |
| Error Handling | The process of detecting, reporting, and recovering from errors or exceptions |
| Recovery Strategy | A plan or procedure for restoring a system to a stable state after a failure or error |
| Test Case | A specific set of inputs, conditions, and expected results used to test a system or component |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of testing failure scenarios include:
- **Failure mode analysis**: identifying potential failure modes and their effects on the system
- **Fault injection**: simulating failures or errors to test the system's response
- **Error handling**: designing and implementing effective error handling mechanisms
- **Recovery strategies**: developing strategies for recovering from failures or errors
- **Test case development**: creating specific test cases to simulate failure scenarios and test the system's response

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for testing failure scenarios involves the following steps:
1. **Failure mode analysis**: identify potential failure modes and their effects on the system
2. **Test case development**: create specific test cases to simulate failure scenarios
3. **Fault injection**: simulate failures or errors to test the system's response
4. **Error handling**: design and implement effective error handling mechanisms
5. **Recovery strategy development**: develop strategies for recovering from failures or errors
6. **Testing and validation**: test and validate the system's response to failure scenarios

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in testing failure scenarios include:
- **Fault injection patterns**: simulating failures or errors to test the system's response
- **Error handling patterns**: designing and implementing effective error handling mechanisms
- **Recovery strategy patterns**: developing strategies for recovering from failures or errors
- **Test case patterns**: creating specific test cases to simulate failure scenarios

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Common anti-patterns in testing failure scenarios include:
- **Insufficient testing**: failing to test the system's response to potential failure scenarios
- **Inadequate error handling**: designing and implementing ineffective error handling mechanisms
- **Inadequate recovery strategies**: failing to develop effective recovery strategies
- **Over-reliance on manual testing**: relying too heavily on manual testing instead of automated testing
