Canonical documentation for 117. Service Account Error Permissions. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 117. Service Account Error Permissions exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The 117. Service Account Error Permissions standard exists to address the class of problems related to inadequate or excessive permissions assigned to service accounts, which can lead to security vulnerabilities, data breaches, or system downtime. The primary purpose of this standard is to provide a framework for managing service account permissions, ensuring that they are properly configured to prevent errors and maintain the security and integrity of the system.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The 117. Service Account Error Permissions standard is based on the concept of least privilege, where service accounts are granted only the necessary permissions to perform their intended functions. This approach helps to minimize the attack surface and reduce the risk of security breaches. The standard also emphasizes the importance of regular permission reviews and updates to ensure that service accounts are properly configured and aligned with changing system requirements.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Service Account | A type of account used by applications or services to interact with the system, without being tied to a specific user. |
| Permission | A setting that determines the level of access or control a service account has over system resources. |
| Least Privilege | A security principle that dictates granting service accounts only the necessary permissions to perform their intended functions. |
| Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) | A security approach that assigns permissions to service accounts based on their roles or functions within the system. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the 117. Service Account Error Permissions standard include:
* Service account management: The process of creating, configuring, and managing service accounts to ensure they have the necessary permissions to perform their intended functions.
* Permission management: The process of assigning, reviewing, and updating permissions for service accounts to ensure they are properly configured and aligned with system requirements.
* Least privilege principle: The concept of granting service accounts only the necessary permissions to perform their intended functions, to minimize the attack surface and reduce the risk of security breaches.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 117. Service Account Error Permissions involves the following components:
* Service account creation: Service accounts are created with a clear understanding of their intended functions and required permissions.
* Permission assignment: Permissions are assigned to service accounts based on their roles or functions within the system, using a role-based access control (RBAC) approach.
* Regular permission reviews: Permissions are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure they are properly configured and aligned with changing system requirements.
* Monitoring and auditing: Service account activity is monitored and audited to detect and respond to potential security incidents.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for 117. Service Account Error Permissions include:
* Using RBAC to assign permissions to service accounts based on their roles or functions within the system.
* Implementing least privilege principles to minimize the attack surface and reduce the risk of security breaches.
* Regularly reviewing and updating permissions to ensure they are properly configured and aligned with changing system requirements.
* Using automation tools to streamline service account management and permission assignment.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for 117. Service Account Error Permissions include:
* Assigning excessive permissions to service accounts, which can increase the attack surface and risk of security breaches.
* Failing to regularly review and update permissions, which can lead to outdated or misconfigured permissions.
* Using a single service account for multiple applications or services, which can increase the risk of security breaches and make it difficult to manage permissions.
* Not monitoring or auditing service account activity, which can make it difficult to detect and respond to potential security incidents.
