# 109. Environment Variable Error Scopes

Canonical documentation for 109. Environment Variable Error Scopes. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 109. Environment Variable Error Scopes exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Environment Variable Error Scopes is to provide a standardized framework for handling and managing errors related to environment variables in software applications. Environment variables are used to store and retrieve configuration settings, credentials, and other sensitive data. However, when errors occur while working with environment variables, it can lead to security vulnerabilities, data corruption, and system crashes. Environment Variable Error Scopes addresses this problem by providing a structured approach to error handling, allowing developers to write more robust and reliable code.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Environment Variable Error Scopes can be thought of as a hierarchical structure that categorizes errors based on their scope and severity. At the top level, errors are classified into categories such as syntax errors, runtime errors, and configuration errors. Each category is further divided into sub-categories, providing a detailed and nuanced understanding of the error landscape. This hierarchical structure enables developers to quickly identify and diagnose errors, reducing the time and effort required to resolve issues.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Environment Variable | A named value stored in the operating system or application environment that can be accessed by the application. |
| Error Scope | The context or boundary within which an error occurs, such as a specific function, module, or system component. |
| Error Severity | The level of impact or damage caused by an error, ranging from minor to critical. |
| Error Category | A classification of errors based on their type, such as syntax, runtime, or configuration errors. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Environment Variable Error Scopes include:
* **Error Classification**: The process of categorizing errors based on their type, scope, and severity.
* **Error Handling**: The mechanisms and strategies used to detect, diagnose, and resolve errors.
* **Error Propagation**: The way errors are transmitted and handled across different components and systems.
* **Error Reporting**: The process of documenting and communicating error information to developers, operators, and end-users.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Environment Variable Error Scopes involves a multi-layered approach to error handling, consisting of:
1. **Error Detection**: Identifying errors as they occur, using techniques such as input validation, error codes, and exception handling.
2. **Error Classification**: Categorizing errors based on their type, scope, and severity, using a hierarchical structure.
3. **Error Handling**: Implementing mechanisms to handle errors, such as retry logic, fallback strategies, and error correction.
4. **Error Reporting**: Documenting and communicating error information, using logging, monitoring, and alerting systems.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Environment Variable Error Scopes include:
* **Try-Catch Blocks**: Using try-catch blocks to catch and handle exceptions, providing a clear and concise way to manage errors.
* **Error Codes**: Using error codes to classify and identify errors, enabling efficient and standardized error handling.
* **Fallback Strategies**: Implementing fallback strategies to provide alternative solutions when errors occur, ensuring system availability and reliability.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Environment Variable Error Scopes include:
* **Error Swallowing**: Ignoring or suppressing errors, rather than handling and reporting them, which can lead to hidden problems and system instability.
* **Overly Broad Error Handling**: Catching and handling errors too broadly, which can mask underlying issues and make debugging more difficult.
* **Inadequate Error Reporting**: Failing to document and communicate error information, making it challenging to diagnose and resolve issues.
