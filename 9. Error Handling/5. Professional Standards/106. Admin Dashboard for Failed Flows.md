# 106. Admin Dashboard for Failed Flows

Canonical documentation for 106. Admin Dashboard for Failed Flows. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
The Admin Dashboard for Failed Flows exists to provide a centralized monitoring and management system for identifying, analyzing, and resolving failed workflow instances. The class of problems it addresses includes workflow failures, error detection, and process optimization. By providing real-time visibility into failed flows, the dashboard enables administrators to quickly identify and address issues, reducing downtime and improving overall system efficiency.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
The Admin Dashboard for Failed Flows is a web-based interface that displays a comprehensive overview of failed workflow instances, including error messages, failure rates, and affected processes. The dashboard provides a high-level mental model of the workflow ecosystem, allowing administrators to navigate and drill down into specific failed flows for detailed analysis and troubleshooting.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Failed Flow | A workflow instance that has encountered an error or exception, resulting in a failed or incomplete process. |
| Workflow Instance | A single execution of a workflow process, which may involve multiple tasks, actions, and decision points. |
| Error Rate | The percentage of workflow instances that have failed or encountered errors within a specified time period. |
| Root Cause Analysis | The process of identifying the underlying cause of a failed flow or error, often involving detailed analysis and troubleshooting. |

## 4. Core Concepts
The fundamental ideas that form the basis of the Admin Dashboard for Failed Flows include:
* Real-time monitoring and notification of failed workflow instances
* Centralized management and analysis of failed flows
* Error detection and root cause analysis
* Process optimization and improvement

## 5. Standard Model
The standard model for the Admin Dashboard for Failed Flows involves a tiered architecture, consisting of:
* Data collection and storage layer
* Data processing and analysis layer
* Presentation and visualization layer
This model provides a scalable and flexible framework for implementing the dashboard, allowing for customization and extension as needed.

## 6. Common Patterns
Common patterns and usage scenarios for the Admin Dashboard for Failed Flows include:
* Real-time monitoring and alerting for failed workflow instances
* Scheduled reporting and analytics for error rates and process performance
* Ad-hoc analysis and troubleshooting for specific failed flows
* Integration with external systems and tools for enhanced functionality and automation

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Common but discouraged practices for the Admin Dashboard for Failed Flows include:
* Over-reliance on manual analysis and troubleshooting
* Insufficient data collection and storage
* Inadequate security and access controls
* Lack of standardization and consistency in dashboard design and implementation
