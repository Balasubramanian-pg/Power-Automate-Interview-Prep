Canonical documentation for 118. Managing API Connection Breaks. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 118. Managing API Connection Breaks exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of managing API connection breaks is to ensure reliable and uninterrupted communication between systems, services, or applications that rely on APIs for data exchange. API connection breaks can occur due to various reasons such as network failures, server crashes, or maintenance downtime, resulting in data loss, delayed processing, or system failures. Managing API connection breaks addresses the class of problems related to API reliability, fault tolerance, and error handling, ensuring that systems can recover from connection breaks and maintain data consistency.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Managing API connection breaks involves a set of strategies and techniques to detect, prevent, and recover from connection breaks. This includes implementing retry mechanisms, circuit breakers, and failovers to ensure that API requests are processed reliably and efficiently. The conceptual model consists of three primary components: connection monitoring, error detection, and recovery mechanisms.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| API | Application Programming Interface, a set of defined rules that enable different applications to communicate with each other. |
| Connection Break | A temporary or permanent loss of connection between an API client and server. |
| Retry Mechanism | A technique to reattempt a failed API request after a specified time interval. |
| Circuit Breaker | A design pattern to detect when a service is not responding and prevent further requests until it becomes available again. |
| Failover | A technique to switch to a redundant system or service in case of a connection break. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of managing API connection breaks include:
* **Connection monitoring**: continuously checking the status of API connections to detect breaks or errors.
* **Error detection**: identifying and categorizing errors that occur during API requests, such as timeouts, network errors, or server errors.
* **Retry mechanisms**: implementing strategies to reattempt failed API requests, such as exponential backoff or linear retry.
* **Circuit breakers**: detecting when a service is not responding and preventing further requests to prevent cascading failures.
* **Failovers**: switching to redundant systems or services to maintain availability and reliability.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for managing API connection breaks involves a combination of connection monitoring, error detection, retry mechanisms, circuit breakers, and failovers. This model includes:
1. **Connection establishment**: establishing a connection between the API client and server.
2. **Connection monitoring**: continuously monitoring the connection for breaks or errors.
3. **Error detection**: detecting and categorizing errors that occur during API requests.
4. **Retry mechanism**: reattempting failed API requests using a retry strategy.
5. **Circuit breaker**: detecting when a service is not responding and preventing further requests.
6. **Failover**: switching to a redundant system or service in case of a connection break.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for managing API connection breaks include:
* **Exponential backoff**: increasing the time interval between retry attempts to prevent overwhelming the server.
* **Linear retry**: retrying failed API requests at a fixed time interval.
* **Circuit breaker with timeout**: detecting when a service is not responding and preventing further requests for a specified time interval.
* **Failover with load balancing**: distributing traffic across multiple redundant systems or services to maintain availability and reliability.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for managing API connection breaks include:
* **Infinite retry**: retrying failed API requests indefinitely, leading to resource exhaustion and cascading failures.
* **No connection monitoring**: failing to monitor API connections, resulting in delayed detection of connection breaks.
* **No error detection**: failing to detect and categorize errors, leading to inadequate retry mechanisms and circuit breakers.
* **No failover**: failing to implement redundant systems or services, resulting in prolonged downtime and data loss.
