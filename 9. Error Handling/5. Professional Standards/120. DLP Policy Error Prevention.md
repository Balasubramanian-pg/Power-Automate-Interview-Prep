# 120. DLP Policy Error Prevention

Canonical documentation for 120. DLP Policy Error Prevention. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 120. DLP Policy Error Prevention exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of 120. DLP Policy Error Prevention is to prevent errors that may occur when implementing Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies. DLP policies are designed to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, if these policies are not properly configured or maintained, they can lead to errors that compromise the security and integrity of the data. The class of problems addressed by 120. DLP Policy Error Prevention includes incorrect policy configuration, inadequate policy enforcement, and insufficient monitoring and reporting.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of 120. DLP Policy Error Prevention involves a comprehensive approach to preventing errors in DLP policy implementation. This includes understanding the organization's data landscape, identifying sensitive data, and developing policies that balance data protection with business requirements. It also involves implementing controls to prevent data breaches, monitoring policy effectiveness, and continuously reviewing and updating policies to ensure they remain relevant and effective.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| DLP Policy | A set of rules and procedures designed to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. |
| Error Prevention | The process of identifying and mitigating potential errors that may occur when implementing DLP policies. |
| Data Loss Prevention | A set of technologies and processes designed to prevent sensitive information from being lost, stolen, or compromised. |
| Policy Configuration | The process of setting up and customizing DLP policies to meet the specific needs of an organization. |
| Policy Enforcement | The process of ensuring that DLP policies are applied consistently and correctly across the organization. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 120. DLP Policy Error Prevention include:
* **Data Classification**: The process of categorizing data based on its sensitivity and importance.
* **Policy Development**: The process of creating DLP policies that balance data protection with business requirements.
* **Policy Implementation**: The process of putting DLP policies into effect, including configuring controls and training users.
* **Monitoring and Reporting**: The process of tracking policy effectiveness and identifying areas for improvement.
* **Continuous Review and Update**: The process of regularly reviewing and updating DLP policies to ensure they remain relevant and effective.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 120. DLP Policy Error Prevention involves a multi-step approach:
1. **Data Discovery**: Identify and classify sensitive data.
2. **Policy Development**: Develop DLP policies that balance data protection with business requirements.
3. **Policy Implementation**: Implement DLP policies, including configuring controls and training users.
4. **Monitoring and Reporting**: Monitor policy effectiveness and track incidents.
5. **Continuous Review and Update**: Regularly review and update DLP policies to ensure they remain relevant and effective.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in 120. DLP Policy Error Prevention include:
* **Template-based Policy Development**: Using pre-built templates to develop DLP policies.
* **Automated Policy Enforcement**: Using automation tools to enforce DLP policies.
* **Regular Policy Review**: Regularly reviewing and updating DLP policies to ensure they remain relevant and effective.
* **User Training and Awareness**: Providing training and awareness programs to educate users about DLP policies and procedures.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in 120. DLP Policy Error Prevention include:
* **Overly Restrictive Policies**: Implementing DLP policies that are too restrictive, which can hinder business operations.
* **Insufficient Monitoring**: Failing to monitor DLP policy effectiveness, which can lead to undetected errors.
* **Lack of User Training**: Failing to provide adequate training and awareness programs for users, which can lead to non-compliance.
* **Inconsistent Policy Enforcement**: Failing to enforce DLP policies consistently, which can lead to errors and inconsistencies.
