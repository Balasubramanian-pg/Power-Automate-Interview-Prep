# 105. Using HTTP Webhooks for Error Logging

Canonical documentation for 105. Using HTTP Webhooks for Error Logging. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 105. Using HTTP Webhooks for Error Logging exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of using HTTP webhooks for error logging is to provide a real-time notification mechanism for errors that occur in a system, application, or service. This approach addresses the problem of delayed or missed error notifications, which can lead to prolonged system downtime, data loss, or security breaches. By leveraging HTTP webhooks, developers can quickly respond to errors, reducing the mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to resolve (MTTR) errors.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of using HTTP webhooks for error logging involves a sender (e.g., an application or service) that triggers an HTTP request to a receiver (e.g., an error logging service or a monitoring tool) when an error occurs. The sender includes relevant error details, such as error messages, stack traces, or user information, in the HTTP request payload. The receiver processes the error data and performs actions like logging, alerting, or triggering automated workflows.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Webhook | A callback function that is triggered by a specific event, in this case, an error occurrence. |
| Error Logging | The process of recording and storing error data for later analysis, debugging, or auditing purposes. |
| HTTP Webhook | A webhook that uses the HTTP protocol to send notifications between systems or services. |
| Payload | The data included in the HTTP request body, which contains error details and other relevant information. |
| Receiver | The system, service, or application that receives and processes the HTTP webhook notification. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of using HTTP webhooks for error logging include:
* **Event-driven architecture**: The sender triggers an HTTP request in response to an error event.
* **Decoupling**: The sender and receiver are loosely coupled, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability.
* **Real-time notification**: The receiver is notified immediately when an error occurs, enabling prompt action.
* **Standardization**: HTTP webhooks provide a standardized mechanism for error notification, facilitating interoperability between systems.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for using HTTP webhooks for error logging involves the following steps:
1. **Error detection**: The sender detects an error and triggers an HTTP request.
2. **Payload construction**: The sender constructs the HTTP request payload, including error details and other relevant data.
3. **Webhook invocation**: The sender invokes the HTTP webhook, sending the request to the receiver.
4. **Error processing**: The receiver processes the error data, performing actions like logging, alerting, or triggering automated workflows.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for using HTTP webhooks for error logging include:
* **Centralized error logging**: Using a single, centralized error logging service to collect and process error data from multiple senders.
* **Distributed error logging**: Using multiple, distributed error logging services to collect and process error data from different senders or systems.
* **Alerting and notification**: Using HTTP webhooks to trigger alerts or notifications to developers, operators, or other stakeholders when errors occur.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for using HTTP webhooks for error logging include:
* **Overloading payload**: Including excessive or unnecessary data in the HTTP request payload, leading to performance issues or data overload.
* **Insecure webhook invocation**: Failing to implement proper security measures, such as authentication or encryption, when invoking HTTP webhooks.
* **Ignoring error handling**: Failing to implement robust error handling mechanisms, leading to missed or unprocessed error notifications.
