> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 116. Peer Reviewing Error Logic exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 116. Peer Reviewing Error Logic is to provide a systematic approach to identifying, analyzing, and mitigating errors that occur during the peer review process. The problem space addressed by this topic includes the challenges of ensuring the quality, reliability, and validity of peer review outcomes, despite the presence of human error, bias, or other factors that can compromise the integrity of the review process.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of 116. Peer Reviewing Error Logic involves a multi-step process that includes error detection, error analysis, and error correction. This process is iterative and recursive, allowing for continuous improvement and refinement of the peer review process. The mental model encompasses the interactions between reviewers, authors, and editors, as well as the technical and social factors that influence the review process.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Peer Review | A critical evaluation of a manuscript or proposal by one or more reviewers who are experts in the same field. |
| Error | A deviation from the expected or intended outcome of the peer review process. |
| Reviewer Bias | A systematic distortion in the review process resulting from the personal beliefs, values, or experiences of the reviewer. |
| Inter-Rater Reliability | The degree of agreement between two or more reviewers evaluating the same manuscript or proposal. |
| Error Rate | The frequency or probability of errors occurring during the peer review process. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 116. Peer Reviewing Error Logic include:
* **Error classification**: categorizing errors into types, such as random errors, systematic errors, or errors of omission.
* **Error detection**: identifying errors through various methods, including statistical analysis, reviewer feedback, or editorial review.
* **Error analysis**: examining the causes and consequences of errors to determine their impact on the peer review process.
* **Error correction**: implementing measures to prevent or mitigate errors, such as reviewer training, process improvements, or technological enhancements.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 116. Peer Reviewing Error Logic involves a combination of human evaluation and technical checks to detect and correct errors. This model includes:
* **Double-blind peer review**: a review process in which the identities of the authors and reviewers are concealed from each other.
* **Multiple reviewer evaluations**: having two or more reviewers evaluate the same manuscript or proposal to improve inter-rater reliability.
* **Editorial review**: having an editor review the manuscript or proposal to detect errors or inconsistencies.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in 116. Peer Reviewing Error Logic include:
* **Reviewer calibration**: training reviewers to evaluate manuscripts or proposals consistently and accurately.
* **Error tracking**: monitoring and recording errors to identify trends and areas for improvement.
* **Process refinement**: continuously improving the peer review process to reduce errors and increase efficiency.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in 116. Peer Reviewing Error Logic include:
* **Lack of transparency**: failing to disclose the peer review process, reviewer identities, or error rates.
* **Insufficient reviewer training**: not providing reviewers with adequate guidance or support to perform their roles effectively.
* **Inadequate error analysis**: neglecting to examine the causes and consequences of errors, leading to repeated mistakes.
