# 104. Creating a Centralized Error Flow

Canonical documentation for 104. Creating a Centralized Error Flow. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 104. Creating a Centralized Error Flow exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of creating a centralized error flow is to provide a unified and standardized approach to handling errors within an application or system. This approach addresses the class of problems related to error handling, such as inconsistent error messages, lack of error tracking, and difficulty in debugging. A centralized error flow helps to improve the overall user experience, reduce debugging time, and increase system reliability.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
A centralized error flow is a design pattern that involves capturing, processing, and logging errors in a single, unified location. This location, often referred to as an error handler or error manager, is responsible for receiving error notifications from various parts of the application, processing the errors, and providing a standardized response. The conceptual model consists of three primary components: error detection, error processing, and error notification.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Error | An unexpected event or condition that occurs during the execution of an application or system. |
| Error Handler | A component responsible for receiving, processing, and logging errors. |
| Error Manager | A centralized component that oversees the error handling process and provides a unified interface for error reporting. |
| Error Notification | The process of informing users, administrators, or other stakeholders about errors that have occurred. |
| Exception | A type of error that is explicitly thrown by an application or system, often to indicate a specific condition or event. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of a centralized error flow include:
* **Error Detection**: Identifying and capturing errors as they occur within the application or system.
* **Error Processing**: Analyzing, logging, and responding to errors in a standardized manner.
* **Error Notification**: Informing relevant stakeholders about errors, including users, administrators, and developers.
* **Error Logging**: Recording errors in a persistent storage mechanism, such as a log file or database, for future analysis and debugging.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for a centralized error flow involves the following steps:
1. **Error Detection**: Errors are detected and captured by the application or system.
2. **Error Reporting**: Errors are reported to the centralized error handler or error manager.
3. **Error Processing**: The error handler or error manager processes the error, including logging and analysis.
4. **Error Notification**: The error handler or error manager notifies relevant stakeholders about the error.
5. **Error Resolution**: The error is resolved, either through automated means or manual intervention.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for a centralized error flow include:
* **Global Error Handling**: Implementing a single, application-wide error handler to capture and process errors.
* **Modular Error Handling**: Implementing error handlers at the module or component level to capture and process errors specific to that module.
* **Asynchronous Error Handling**: Implementing error handling mechanisms that operate asynchronously, such as logging errors to a database or file.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for a centralized error flow include:
* **Error Swallowing**: Ignoring or suppressing errors, rather than capturing and processing them.
* **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Implementing error handling mechanisms that are inconsistent across the application or system.
* **Lack of Error Logging**: Failing to log errors, making it difficult to diagnose and debug issues.
