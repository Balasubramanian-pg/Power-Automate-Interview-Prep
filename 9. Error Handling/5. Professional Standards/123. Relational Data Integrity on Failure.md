> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 123. Relational Data Integrity on Failure exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Relational Data Integrity on Failure is to ensure that database systems maintain data consistency and integrity even in the event of failures, such as hardware or software crashes, network errors, or other unforeseen circumstances. This is crucial in maintaining the reliability and trustworthiness of relational databases, which are widely used in various applications, including financial transactions, healthcare, and e-commerce. The class of problems addressed by Relational Data Integrity on Failure includes data corruption, inconsistencies, and loss of data, which can have severe consequences, such as financial losses, compromised security, and damage to reputation.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Relational Data Integrity on Failure involves a set of mechanisms and techniques that ensure the consistency and integrity of relational data in the face of failures. This includes backup and recovery mechanisms, transactional logging, locking mechanisms, and error detection and correction techniques. The conceptual model of Relational Data Integrity on Failure involves a combination of these mechanisms to provide a robust and reliable database system that can recover from failures and maintain data integrity.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Atomicity | The property of a transaction that ensures it is executed as a single, indivisible unit of work. |
| Consistency | The property of a database that ensures it remains in a valid state, even after a failure. |
| Durability | The property of a transaction that ensures its effects are permanent and survive even in the event of a failure. |
| Isolation | The property of a transaction that ensures it is executed independently of other transactions. |
| Rollback | The process of reversing the effects of a transaction in the event of a failure. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Relational Data Integrity on Failure include atomicity, consistency, durability, and isolation. These concepts are fundamental to ensuring the reliability and trustworthiness of relational databases. Atomicity ensures that transactions are executed as a single unit of work, while consistency ensures that the database remains in a valid state. Durability ensures that the effects of a transaction are permanent, and isolation ensures that transactions are executed independently.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Relational Data Integrity on Failure involves a combination of backup and recovery mechanisms, transactional logging, locking mechanisms, and error detection and correction techniques. This model includes the use of transaction logs to record changes made to the database, locking mechanisms to prevent concurrent access to data, and backup and recovery mechanisms to restore the database in the event of a failure.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Relational Data Integrity on Failure include the use of transactional logging, locking mechanisms, and backup and recovery mechanisms. These patterns are widely accepted and used in various relational database management systems. Additionally, patterns such as data replication and mirroring are also used to ensure high availability and reliability of relational databases.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Common anti-patterns for Relational Data Integrity on Failure include the use of inadequate backup and recovery mechanisms, insufficient transactional logging, and poor locking mechanisms. These anti-patterns can lead to data corruption, inconsistencies, and loss of data, which can have severe consequences. Additionally, anti-patterns such as ignoring error detection and correction techniques can also compromise the reliability and trustworthiness of relational databases.
