# 122. Handling Large File Upload Failures

Canonical documentation for 122. Handling Large File Upload Failures. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 122. Handling Large File Upload Failures exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of handling large file upload failures is to ensure that applications can manage and recover from errors that occur during the upload process of large files, providing a seamless user experience and preventing data loss. This topic addresses the class of problems related to uploading large files, including network failures, server crashes, and timeouts, which can result in incomplete or corrupted uploads.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Handling large file upload failures involves a combination of techniques, including chunking, checksum validation, and retry mechanisms. Chunking involves breaking down large files into smaller, more manageable pieces, which are then uploaded separately. Checksum validation ensures the integrity of the uploaded data, while retry mechanisms allow the application to recover from failures and resume the upload process.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Chunking | The process of breaking down a large file into smaller, more manageable pieces for upload |
| Checksum | A digital fingerprint of a file, used to verify its integrity and authenticity |
| Retry Mechanism | A technique used to recover from upload failures, allowing the application to resume the upload process |
| Upload Token | A unique identifier assigned to an upload session, used to track progress and manage retries |
| Timeout | A predetermined period of time after which an upload is considered failed if no progress is made |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of handling large file upload failures include:
* **Reliability**: Ensuring that the upload process is robust and can recover from failures
* **Integrity**: Verifying the accuracy and completeness of the uploaded data
* **Performance**: Optimizing the upload process to minimize latency and maximize throughput
* **Security**: Protecting the uploaded data from unauthorized access or tampering

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for handling large file upload failures involves the following steps:
1. **Initialization**: The client initiates the upload process and receives an upload token
2. **Chunking**: The client breaks down the large file into smaller chunks and uploads each chunk separately
3. **Checksum Validation**: The server verifies the integrity of each chunk using checksums
4. **Retry Mechanism**: The client and server collaborate to recover from upload failures using retry mechanisms
5. **Completion**: The upload process is completed, and the client receives confirmation of success or failure

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for handling large file upload failures include:
* **Exponential Backoff**: Increasing the delay between retries to prevent overwhelming the server
* **Upload Resumption**: Allowing the client to resume an interrupted upload from the point of failure
* **Chunk-Level Retry**: Retrying individual chunks that fail, rather than the entire upload

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for handling large file upload failures include:
* **Single-Threaded Uploads**: Uploading large files in a single thread, which can lead to performance bottlenecks and increased latency
* **Lack of Checksum Validation**: Failing to verify the integrity of uploaded data, which can result in corrupted or incomplete files
* **Inadequate Retry Mechanisms**: Implementing retry mechanisms that are insufficient or poorly designed, leading to repeated failures and frustration
