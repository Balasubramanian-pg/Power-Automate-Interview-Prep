# 111. Validating User Input at Source

Canonical documentation for 111. Validating User Input at Source. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 111. Validating User Input at Source exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of validating user input at source is to prevent malicious or erroneous data from entering an application or system, thereby protecting against potential security vulnerabilities, data corruption, or system crashes. This approach addresses a broad class of problems, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and buffer overflow attacks, which can have severe consequences if left unchecked.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Validating user input at source involves a proactive and multi-layered approach to ensuring the integrity and accuracy of data entered by users. This encompasses a range of techniques, from basic syntax checking to more advanced semantic validation, all aimed at verifying that the input conforms to expected formats, ranges, and business rules. By doing so, applications can significantly reduce the risk of security breaches and data inconsistencies, thereby enhancing overall system reliability and user trust.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Input Validation | The process of checking and ensuring that user-provided data meets specific criteria and is free from malicious content. |
| Sanitization | The act of removing or escaping harmful characters from user input to prevent security vulnerabilities. |
| Whitelisting | A security approach that only allows specific, known good input, thereby rejecting all other inputs. |
| Blacklisting | A method that blocks specific, known bad inputs but allows all other inputs, which can be less secure than whitelisting. |
| Error Handling | The process of gracefully managing and responding to invalid or unexpected user input. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of validating user input at source include understanding the types of threats (e.g., SQL injection, XSS), knowing the input sources (e.g., forms, APIs), and applying appropriate validation techniques (e.g., format checking, range validation). Additionally, concepts like least privilege, fail-safe defaults, and continuous monitoring are crucial in ensuring the effectiveness and robustness of input validation mechanisms.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for validating user input at source typically involves a combination of the following steps: 
1. **Definition of Requirements**: Clearly outlining what constitutes valid input.
2. **Input Validation**: Checking the input against predefined rules and criteria.
3. **Sanitization**: Cleaning the input to remove potential threats.
4. **Error Handling**: Managing and responding to invalid input in a user-friendly manner.
5. **Continuous Monitoring and Feedback**: Regularly reviewing the effectiveness of the validation process and incorporating user feedback for improvements.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in validating user input include using regular expressions for format validation, implementing CAPTCHAs to distinguish human from automated inputs, and utilizing libraries or frameworks that provide built-in validation functionalities. Additionally, patterns like client-side validation for immediate user feedback and server-side validation for security are widely adopted.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in input validation include over-reliance on client-side validation without server-side checks, using blacklisting as the sole method of validation, and neglecting to validate data from trusted sources (assuming they are inherently secure). Another significant anti-pattern is not keeping validation rules up-to-date with changing business requirements or new types of threats.
