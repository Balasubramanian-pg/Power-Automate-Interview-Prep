Canonical documentation for 108. ALM Considerations for Error Handling. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 108. ALM Considerations for Error Handling exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 108. ALM Considerations for Error Handling is to provide a framework for managing errors within Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) systems. This framework addresses the class of problems related to error detection, reporting, and resolution, ensuring that errors are handled efficiently and effectively throughout the application lifecycle. The problem space includes error handling in various ALM phases, such as development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of 108. ALM Considerations for Error Handling involves a comprehensive approach to error management, encompassing error prevention, detection, reporting, analysis, and resolution. This approach integrates error handling into the overall ALM process, ensuring that errors are addressed proactively and reactively, minimizing their impact on the application and its users.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Error | An unexpected condition or exception that occurs during the execution of an application or system. |
| Exception | A type of error that can be anticipated and handled by the application or system. |
| Fault | A defect or bug in the application or system that can cause errors or exceptions. |
| Failure | The inability of an application or system to perform its intended function due to an error, exception, or fault. |
| ALM | Application Lifecycle Management, a set of processes and practices used to manage the development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of applications. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 108. ALM Considerations for Error Handling include:
* Error prevention: designing and implementing applications and systems to minimize the occurrence of errors.
* Error detection: identifying and reporting errors when they occur.
* Error analysis: examining errors to determine their root cause and impact.
* Error resolution: taking corrective action to resolve errors and prevent their recurrence.
* Error reporting: documenting and communicating errors to stakeholders.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 108. ALM Considerations for Error Handling involves a structured approach to error management, consisting of:
1. Error prevention: implementing design and coding practices that minimize errors.
2. Error detection: using testing, logging, and monitoring to identify errors.
3. Error analysis: performing root cause analysis to determine the underlying cause of errors.
4. Error resolution: taking corrective action to resolve errors and prevent their recurrence.
5. Error reporting: documenting and communicating errors to stakeholders.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in 108. ALM Considerations for Error Handling include:
* Try-catch blocks: using programming constructs to catch and handle exceptions.
* Error logging: recording errors in a log file or database for later analysis.
* Error notification: notifying stakeholders, such as developers or administrators, of errors.
* Fail-safe defaults: designing applications and systems to fail in a safe and predictable manner.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in 108. ALM Considerations for Error Handling include:
* Error suppression: ignoring or hiding errors, rather than addressing their root cause.
* Inadequate error reporting: failing to document or communicate errors to stakeholders.
* Insufficient testing: not testing applications and systems thoroughly, leading to undetected errors.
* Lack of error analysis: not examining errors to determine their root cause and impact.
