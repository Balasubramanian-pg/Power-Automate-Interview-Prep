# 107. Monitoring Service Health

Canonical documentation for 107. Monitoring Service Health. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 107. Monitoring Service Health exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of monitoring service health is to ensure the reliability, performance, and overall quality of services in various environments, including cloud, on-premises, and hybrid infrastructures. The problem space includes service downtime, slow response times, errors, and other issues that can impact user experience and business operations. Monitoring service health addresses these problems by providing real-time insights into service performance, enabling proactive maintenance, and facilitating prompt incident response.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Monitoring service health involves collecting and analyzing data from various sources, including logs, metrics, and user feedback. This data is used to identify trends, detect anomalies, and predict potential issues. The conceptual model consists of three primary components: data collection, data analysis, and action triggering. Data collection involves gathering relevant data from services and infrastructure. Data analysis involves processing and interpreting the collected data to identify patterns and anomalies. Action triggering involves taking corrective actions based on the insights gained from data analysis, such as sending alerts, scaling resources, or performing maintenance tasks.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Service | A software component or application that provides a specific functionality or capability. |
| Health | The overall state of a service, including its performance, reliability, and quality. |
| Monitoring | The process of collecting, analyzing, and acting on data to ensure the health and quality of services. |
| Metric | A measurable value that provides insight into service performance, such as response time, error rate, or throughput. |
| Log | A record of events or transactions that occur within a service or system. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of monitoring service health include:
* **Service instrumentation**: The process of adding logging, metrics, and other monitoring capabilities to services.
* **Data collection**: The process of gathering data from services and infrastructure.
* **Data analysis**: The process of processing and interpreting collected data to identify patterns and anomalies.
* **Alerting and notification**: The process of sending alerts and notifications to stakeholders when issues are detected.
* **Incident response**: The process of responding to and resolving incidents that impact service health.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for monitoring service health involves a layered approach, consisting of:
* **Infrastructure monitoring**: Monitoring the underlying infrastructure, including servers, networks, and storage.
* **Application monitoring**: Monitoring the application or service, including its performance, errors, and user experience.
* **Business monitoring**: Monitoring business-level metrics, such as revenue, customer satisfaction, and market share.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in monitoring service health include:
* **Threshold-based alerting**: Sending alerts when metrics exceed predefined thresholds.
* **Anomaly detection**: Identifying unusual patterns or behavior in service data.
* **Root cause analysis**: Identifying the underlying cause of issues or incidents.
* **Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)**: Integrating monitoring into CI/CD pipelines to ensure service quality and reliability.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in monitoring service health include:
* **Over-monitoring**: Collecting too much data, leading to information overload and decreased signal-to-noise ratio.
* **Under-monitoring**: Collecting too little data, leading to blind spots and decreased visibility.
* **Alert fatigue**: Sending too many alerts, leading to desensitization and decreased response.
* **Lack of automation**: Failing to automate monitoring and incident response, leading to manual errors and decreased efficiency.
