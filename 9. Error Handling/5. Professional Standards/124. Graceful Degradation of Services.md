Canonical documentation for 124. Graceful Degradation of Services. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 124. Graceful Degradation of Services exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 124. Graceful Degradation of Services is to ensure that systems and services can continue to operate and provide value to users even when faced with unexpected failures, errors, or resource constraints. This approach acknowledges that failures are inevitable and instead of trying to prevent them entirely, it focuses on mitigating their impact and ensuring a smooth user experience. The class of problems addressed by 124. Graceful Degradation of Services includes handling network failures, server crashes, database errors, and other types of system disruptions that can affect service availability and performance.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of 124. Graceful Degradation of Services involves a multi-layered approach to system design, where each layer is designed to fail gracefully in the event of an error or failure. This includes designing systems with redundancy, implementing fault-tolerant protocols, and using load balancing and traffic management techniques to distribute workload and minimize the impact of failures. The model also emphasizes the importance of monitoring, logging, and analytics in detecting and responding to failures, as well as implementing automated recovery mechanisms to minimize downtime and ensure rapid recovery.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Fault Tolerance | The ability of a system to continue operating even when one or more components fail. |
| Graceful Degradation | The ability of a system to reduce its functionality or performance in a controlled manner in response to failures or resource constraints. |
| Load Balancing | A technique used to distribute workload across multiple servers or resources to improve responsiveness, reliability, and scalability. |
| Redundancy | The duplication of critical components or systems to ensure continued operation in the event of a failure. |
| Failover | The automatic switching to a redundant system or component in the event of a failure. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 124. Graceful Degradation of Services include designing systems with fault tolerance, redundancy, and load balancing in mind. This involves identifying critical components and systems, duplicating them where possible, and implementing protocols to detect and respond to failures. Additionally, the concept of graceful degradation is critical, as it allows systems to reduce their functionality or performance in a controlled manner in response to failures or resource constraints, ensuring a smooth user experience and minimizing the impact of failures.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 124. Graceful Degradation of Services involves a layered approach to system design, with each layer designed to fail gracefully in the event of an error or failure. This includes:
* Presentation Layer: responsible for user interaction and feedback
* Application Layer: responsible for business logic and processing
* Data Layer: responsible for data storage and retrieval
* Infrastructure Layer: responsible for underlying infrastructure and resources
Each layer is designed to be redundant, with fault-tolerant protocols and load balancing techniques used to distribute workload and minimize the impact of failures.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for 124. Graceful Degradation of Services include:
* Caching: storing frequently accessed data in memory to reduce the load on underlying systems
* Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): distributing content across multiple servers to improve responsiveness and reduce the load on origin servers
* Database replication: duplicating database instances to improve availability and reduce the risk of data loss
* Load balancing: distributing workload across multiple servers to improve responsiveness and reliability

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for 124. Graceful Degradation of Services include:
* Single points of failure: designing systems with single points of failure, where the failure of one component can bring down the entire system
* Tight coupling: designing systems with tightly coupled components, where the failure of one component can have a ripple effect throughout the system
* Lack of monitoring and logging: failing to monitor and log system activity, making it difficult to detect and respond to failures
* Insufficient testing: failing to test systems thoroughly, leading to unexpected failures and errors in production
