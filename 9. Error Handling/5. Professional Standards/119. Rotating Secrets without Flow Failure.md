# 119. Rotating Secrets without Flow Failure

Canonical documentation for 119. Rotating Secrets without Flow Failure. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 119. Rotating Secrets without Flow Failure exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of rotating secrets without flow failure is to ensure the continuous security and integrity of sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, and certificates, used in various applications and systems. The class of problems it addresses includes the risks associated with static or infrequently changed secrets, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and system compromises. Rotating secrets without flow failure aims to minimize these risks by regularly updating sensitive information without disrupting the normal functioning of dependent systems.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of rotating secrets without flow failure involves a cyclical process of generating, distributing, and revoking sensitive information. This process is designed to be automated, secure, and transparent, ensuring that secrets are updated regularly without impacting the availability or performance of dependent systems. The model encompasses various components, including secret management systems, authentication and authorization mechanisms, and monitoring and auditing tools.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Secret | Sensitive information, such as a password, API key, or certificate, used to authenticate or authorize access to a system or application. |
| Secret Rotation | The process of generating, distributing, and revoking secrets on a regular basis to minimize the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. |
| Flow Failure | A disruption or interruption to the normal functioning of a system or application, often caused by the rotation of secrets. |
| Secret Management System | A system or tool used to generate, store, distribute, and revoke secrets, often providing additional features such as access control, auditing, and monitoring. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of rotating secrets without flow failure include:
* **Secret generation**: The process of creating new, unique secrets to replace existing ones.
* **Secret distribution**: The process of securely distributing new secrets to dependent systems or applications.
* **Secret revocation**: The process of removing or invalidating existing secrets to prevent unauthorized access.
* **Automation**: The use of automated tools and processes to rotate secrets, minimizing the risk of human error or disruption.
* **Monitoring and auditing**: The use of monitoring and auditing tools to detect and respond to potential security incidents or flow failures.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for rotating secrets without flow failure involves a multi-step process:
1. **Secret generation**: Generate new secrets using a secure random number generator or a trusted secret management system.
2. **Secret distribution**: Distribute new secrets to dependent systems or applications, using secure communication protocols such as HTTPS or SFTP.
3. **Secret activation**: Activate new secrets, allowing dependent systems or applications to use them for authentication or authorization.
4. **Secret revocation**: Revoke existing secrets, removing or invalidating them to prevent unauthorized access.
5. **Monitoring and auditing**: Monitor and audit the secret rotation process, detecting and responding to potential security incidents or flow failures.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for rotating secrets without flow failure include:
* **Time-based rotation**: Rotating secrets at regular time intervals, such as daily, weekly, or monthly.
* **Event-based rotation**: Rotating secrets in response to specific events, such as a security incident or a change in personnel.
* **Hybrid rotation**: Combining time-based and event-based rotation, providing a flexible and adaptive approach to secret rotation.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for rotating secrets without flow failure include:
* **Static secrets**: Using static or infrequently changed secrets, which can increase the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.
* **Manual rotation**: Rotating secrets manually, which can be error-prone and time-consuming.
* **Insecure distribution**: Distributing secrets using insecure communication protocols or methods, such as plaintext emails or unsecured file shares.
