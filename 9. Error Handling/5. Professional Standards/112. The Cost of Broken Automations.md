# 112. The Cost of Broken Automations

Canonical documentation for 112. The Cost of Broken Automations. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 112. The Cost of Broken Automations exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Cost of Broken Automations exists to highlight the financial and operational impacts of automation failures on organizations. The class of problems it addresses includes the inefficiencies, errors, and wasted resources that occur when automations fail or do not perform as intended. This can lead to significant costs, including lost productivity, manual workarounds, and reputational damage.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Cost of Broken Automations can be understood as a framework for evaluating the consequences of automation failures. It considers the direct and indirect costs associated with automation breakdowns, including the costs of repair, maintenance, and mitigation, as well as the opportunity costs of delayed or failed automation projects.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Automation | The use of technology to automate repetitive or mundane tasks, reducing the need for human intervention. |
| Automation Failure | An event where an automation system fails to perform its intended function, resulting in errors, delays, or other negative consequences. |
| Cost of Broken Automations | The total cost of ownership and operation of automation systems, including the costs of failures, repairs, and maintenance. |
| Return on Automation (ROA) | A metric used to evaluate the financial return on investment (ROI) of automation projects, considering both the benefits and costs of automation. |
| Automation Maturity | The degree to which an organization has developed and implemented automation capabilities, including the ability to monitor, maintain, and improve automation systems. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of The Cost of Broken Automations include:
* Automation as a critical component of modern business operations
* The potential for automation failures to have significant financial and operational impacts
* The importance of evaluating the total cost of ownership and operation of automation systems
* The need for organizations to develop automation maturity and implement robust automation governance practices

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for evaluating The Cost of Broken Automations includes:
1. Identifying automation failures and their causes
2. Assessing the direct and indirect costs of automation failures
3. Evaluating the return on automation (ROA) for automation projects
4. Developing and implementing automation governance practices to mitigate the risks of automation failures
5. Continuously monitoring and improving automation systems to optimize performance and minimize costs

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in The Cost of Broken Automations include:
* Implementing automation solutions without fully considering the potential risks and costs
* Failing to develop and implement robust automation governance practices
* Underestimating the complexity and difficulty of automation projects
* Overrelying on manual workarounds to mitigate automation failures
* Failing to continuously monitor and improve automation systems

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in The Cost of Broken Automations include:
* Ignoring or downplaying the risks and costs of automation failures
* Failing to develop and implement automation governance practices
* Overautomating processes without considering the potential consequences
* Underinvesting in automation maintenance and support
* Failing to evaluate the return on automation (ROA) for automation projects
