# 121. CoE Toolkit Error Reporting

Canonical documentation for 121. CoE Toolkit Error Reporting. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 121. CoE Toolkit Error Reporting exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The 121. CoE Toolkit Error Reporting is designed to provide a standardized framework for reporting and managing errors within the Center of Excellence (CoE) toolkit. The primary purpose of this framework is to ensure that errors are properly documented, tracked, and resolved in a timely and efficient manner. The class of problems addressed by this framework includes error detection, error reporting, error analysis, and error resolution.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The 121. CoE Toolkit Error Reporting framework consists of several key components, including error detection mechanisms, reporting tools, and analytics platforms. These components work together to identify, document, and resolve errors within the CoE toolkit. The framework is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing it to be applied to a wide range of error reporting scenarios.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Error | An unexpected event or condition that occurs within the CoE toolkit, resulting in a deviation from expected behavior. |
| Error Report | A document or record that describes an error, including its symptoms, causes, and resolution. |
| Error Code | A unique identifier assigned to a specific error, used to track and manage error reports. |
| Error Severity | A measure of the impact or severity of an error, used to prioritize error resolution efforts. |
| Error Resolution | The process of identifying and implementing a solution to an error, resulting in the restoration of normal functionality. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The 121. CoE Toolkit Error Reporting framework is based on several core concepts, including:
* Error detection and reporting: The ability to identify and document errors within the CoE toolkit.
* Error analysis: The process of examining error reports to identify root causes and trends.
* Error resolution: The process of implementing solutions to errors, resulting in the restoration of normal functionality.
* Error tracking: The ability to monitor and manage error reports, including assignment, prioritization, and resolution.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 121. CoE Toolkit Error Reporting includes the following components:
* Error detection mechanisms, such as logging and monitoring tools.
* Reporting tools, such as web-based forms or mobile applications.
* Analytics platforms, such as data visualization tools or machine learning algorithms.
* Error tracking and management systems, such as issue tracking software or project management tools.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in 121. CoE Toolkit Error Reporting include:
* Automated error detection and reporting, using tools such as logging and monitoring software.
* Centralized error tracking and management, using tools such as issue tracking software or project management tools.
* Data-driven error analysis, using tools such as data visualization software or machine learning algorithms.
* Collaborative error resolution, using tools such as communication platforms or workflow management software.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in 121. CoE Toolkit Error Reporting include:
* Manual error detection and reporting, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors.
* Decentralized error tracking and management, which can lead to confusion and duplication of effort.
* Lack of error analysis, which can make it difficult to identify root causes and trends.
* Inadequate error resolution, which can result in recurring errors and decreased system reliability.
