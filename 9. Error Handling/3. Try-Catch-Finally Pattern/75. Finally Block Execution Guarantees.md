# 75. Finally Block Execution Guarantees

Canonical documentation for 75. Finally Block Execution Guarantees. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 75. Finally Block Execution Guarantees exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Finally Block Execution Guarantees is to ensure that certain code is executed after the execution of a try block, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not. This addresses the problem of resource leaks, where resources such as files, connections, or locks are not properly released after use. By providing a guarantee that the finally block will be executed, developers can ensure that resources are properly cleaned up, even in the presence of exceptions.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Finally Block Execution Guarantees concept can be thought of as a safety net that ensures the execution of critical code, such as resource cleanup, after the main execution path has completed. This concept is based on the idea of a try-finally block, where the try block contains the main execution code, and the finally block contains the code that must be executed regardless of the outcome of the try block.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Try Block | A block of code that contains the main execution path and may throw exceptions. |
| Finally Block | A block of code that is executed after the try block, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not. |
| Exception | An event that occurs during the execution of a program, such as an error or an unexpected condition. |
| Resource | An entity that must be acquired and released, such as a file, connection, or lock. |
| Cleanup Code | Code that is responsible for releasing resources and performing other necessary cleanup tasks. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Finally Block Execution Guarantees are:
* The try-finally block structure, which ensures that the finally block is executed after the try block.
* The guarantee that the finally block will be executed, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not.
* The importance of proper resource cleanup and release to prevent resource leaks.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Finally Block Execution Guarantees is the try-finally block structure, where the try block contains the main execution code, and the finally block contains the cleanup code. This model is widely accepted and recommended because it provides a clear and concise way to ensure that resources are properly cleaned up, even in the presence of exceptions.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Finally Block Execution Guarantees include:
* Using a try-finally block to ensure that resources are properly released, such as closing files or connections.
* Using a finally block to perform cleanup tasks, such as deleting temporary files or unlocking resources.
* Using a try-catch-finally block to handle exceptions and ensure that resources are properly cleaned up.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Finally Block Execution Guarantees include:
* Not using a finally block to ensure that resources are properly cleaned up, leading to resource leaks.
* Using a finally block to perform tasks that are not related to cleanup or resource release.
* Throwing exceptions from a finally block, which can lead to unexpected behavior and make it difficult to debug issues.
