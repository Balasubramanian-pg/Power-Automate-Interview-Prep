# 69. Catching Specific Action Failures

Canonical documentation for 69. Catching Specific Action Failures. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 69. Catching Specific Action Failures exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Catching Specific Action Failures is a crucial aspect of robust system design, aiming to handle and recover from failures that occur during specific actions or operations. This approach acknowledges that failures are inevitable in complex systems and provides a mechanism to mitigate their impact. The primary problem it addresses is the need for systems to gracefully handle failures, ensuring reliability, and minimizing downtime.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of Catching Specific Action Failures involves identifying potential failure points within a system, implementing targeted failure detection mechanisms, and designing recovery strategies to handle these failures. This model emphasizes the importance of understanding the specific actions that could lead to failures and preparing the system to respond appropriately when such failures occur.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Action | A specific operation or set of operations performed by a system. |
| Failure | An event where an action does not achieve its intended outcome. |
| Failure Handling | The process of detecting, analyzing, and recovering from failures. |
| Recovery Strategy | A predefined plan or set of actions to restore system functionality after a failure. |
| Exception | An abnormal condition that requires special handling to prevent system failure. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Catching Specific Action Failures include:
- **Failure Identification**: Recognizing which actions are prone to failures.
- **Failure Detection**: Implementing mechanisms to detect when a failure occurs.
- **Failure Analysis**: Understanding the cause and impact of the failure.
- **Recovery**: Executing a recovery strategy to restore system functionality.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Catching Specific Action Failures involves a structured approach:
1. **Failure Mode Identification**: Identify potential failure modes for each action.
2. **Failure Detection Mechanism**: Implement detection mechanisms for identified failure modes.
3. **Failure Handling Protocol**: Establish protocols for handling detected failures, including analysis and recovery.
4. **Recovery Strategy Implementation**: Implement recovery strategies to restore system functionality.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Catching Specific Action Failures include:
- **Try-Catch Blocks**: Using programming constructs to catch and handle exceptions.
- **Fallback Strategies**: Implementing alternative actions when primary actions fail.
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatically retrying failed actions after a specified interval.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns to avoid include:
- **Ignoring Failures**: Failing to implement any form of failure handling.
- **Overly Broad Error Handling**: Catching exceptions too broadly, potentially masking other issues.
- **Inadequate Logging**: Not logging failures, making diagnosis and debugging difficult.
