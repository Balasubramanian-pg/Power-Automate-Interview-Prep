> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 55. Constructing HTML Error Tables exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of constructing HTML error tables is to provide a standardized and user-friendly way to display error messages and exceptions in web applications. This addresses the problem of effectively communicating errors to users, which is crucial for a good user experience and for facilitating debugging and troubleshooting.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Constructing HTML error tables involves creating a structured representation of error data using HTML elements, such as tables, lists, and paragraphs. This structure should be designed to be easily readable and understandable by users, and should provide clear and concise information about the errors that have occurred.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Error Table | A structured representation of error data using HTML elements. |
| Error Message | A human-readable description of an error or exception. |
| Error Code | A unique identifier for a specific error or exception. |
| Severity Level | A classification of the severity of an error, such as warning, error, or fatal. |
| Error Context | Additional information about the error, such as the location or circumstances in which it occurred. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of constructing HTML error tables include:
* **Error classification**: categorizing errors by type, severity, and context to provide a clear understanding of the issue.
* **Error messaging**: crafting clear and concise error messages that provide useful information to users.
* **Error presentation**: using HTML elements to create a structured and readable representation of error data.
* **Accessibility**: ensuring that error tables are accessible to users with disabilities, such as those using screen readers.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for constructing HTML error tables involves using a combination of HTML elements, such as:
* **Table**: to provide a structured representation of error data.
* **List**: to display a list of error messages or codes.
* **Paragraph**: to provide additional context or information about the error.
* **Header**: to provide a clear and concise title or heading for the error table.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for constructing HTML error tables include:
* **Error summary**: providing a brief summary of the error, including the error code and message.
* **Error details**: providing additional information about the error, such as the location or circumstances in which it occurred.
* **Error suggestions**: providing suggestions or recommendations for resolving the error.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for constructing HTML error tables include:
* **Using tables for layout**: using tables to control the layout of the error table, rather than to provide a structured representation of error data.
* **Using unclear or ambiguous language**: using language that is unclear or ambiguous, which can confuse or mislead users.
* **Not providing sufficient context**: not providing sufficient context or information about the error, which can make it difficult for users to understand or resolve the issue.
