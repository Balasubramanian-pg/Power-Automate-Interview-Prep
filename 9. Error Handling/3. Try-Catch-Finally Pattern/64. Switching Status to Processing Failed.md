# 64. Switching Status to Processing Failed

Canonical documentation for 64. Switching Status to Processing Failed. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 64. Switching Status to Processing Failed exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of switching status to processing failed is to handle exceptions and errors that occur during the execution of a process or task. This mechanism allows for the identification, logging, and potential recovery of failed operations, ensuring that the system remains in a consistent state and providing valuable insights for debugging and improvement. The class of problems it addresses includes error handling, exception management, and process reliability.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of switching status to processing failed involves a state machine that transitions between different statuses, such as "pending," "in progress," "completed," and "failed." When a process encounters an error or exception, the state machine switches to the "failed" status, triggering error handling mechanisms and notifying relevant stakeholders.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Processing Failed | A status indicating that a process or task has failed to complete due to an error or exception. |
| Error Handling | The process of detecting, logging, and recovering from errors that occur during the execution of a process or task. |
| Exception Management | The practice of identifying, classifying, and responding to exceptions that occur during the execution of a process or task. |
| State Machine | A mathematical model that can be in one of a finite number of states and can transition between these states based on certain rules. |
| Status Transition | The act of changing the status of a process or task from one state to another. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of switching status to processing failed include:
* Error detection: identifying errors or exceptions that occur during the execution of a process or task.
* Status transition: changing the status of a process or task from one state to another, such as from "in progress" to "failed."
* Error handling: logging, notifying, and recovering from errors that occur during the execution of a process or task.
* Exception management: identifying, classifying, and responding to exceptions that occur during the execution of a process or task.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for switching status to processing failed involves a state machine with the following states:
* Pending: the initial state, indicating that the process or task is waiting to be executed.
* In Progress: the state indicating that the process or task is being executed.
* Completed: the state indicating that the process or task has been successfully completed.
* Failed: the state indicating that the process or task has failed to complete due to an error or exception.
The state machine transitions between these states based on certain rules, such as error detection and exception management.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for switching status to processing failed include:
* Retry pattern: retrying a failed process or task a certain number of times before switching to the "failed" status.
* Timeout pattern: switching to the "failed" status if a process or task takes longer than a certain amount of time to complete.
* Error logging pattern: logging errors that occur during the execution of a process or task, including the error message, timestamp, and other relevant information.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for switching status to processing failed include:
* Ignoring errors: failing to detect, log, or respond to errors that occur during the execution of a process or task.
* Overly broad error handling: catching and handling exceptions that are too broad, such as catching all exceptions instead of specific ones.
* Inconsistent status transitions: transitioning between states in an inconsistent or unpredictable manner.
