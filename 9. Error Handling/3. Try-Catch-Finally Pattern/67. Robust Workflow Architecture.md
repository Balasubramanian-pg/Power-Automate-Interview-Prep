# 67. Robust Workflow Architecture

Canonical documentation for 67. Robust Workflow Architecture. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 67. Robust Workflow Architecture exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The 67. Robust Workflow Architecture exists to provide a structured approach to designing and implementing workflows that are resilient, scalable, and maintainable. It addresses the class of problems related to workflow management, including workflow definition, execution, monitoring, and optimization. The primary goal of this architecture is to ensure that workflows can handle failures, exceptions, and changes in the underlying systems or processes, while minimizing the impact on the overall business operations.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The 67. Robust Workflow Architecture is based on a modular, layered approach that separates the workflow definition, execution, and monitoring into distinct components. This allows for greater flexibility, scalability, and maintainability. The architecture consists of the following layers: workflow definition, workflow execution, workflow monitoring, and workflow optimization. Each layer interacts with the others through well-defined interfaces, enabling seamless communication and data exchange.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Workflow | A series of activities or tasks that are executed in a specific order to achieve a business goal or objective. |
| Workflow Definition | The process of designing and configuring a workflow, including defining the activities, tasks, and rules that govern its execution. |
| Workflow Execution | The process of running a workflow, including the execution of activities, tasks, and rules. |
| Workflow Monitoring | The process of tracking and analyzing the execution of a workflow, including the collection and analysis of metrics and logs. |
| Workflow Optimization | The process of improving the performance and efficiency of a workflow, including the identification and implementation of improvements. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The 67. Robust Workflow Architecture is based on the following core concepts:
* **Modularity**: The architecture is designed to be modular, with each component or layer interacting with others through well-defined interfaces.
* **Layering**: The architecture consists of distinct layers, each with its own specific function and responsibility.
* **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer or component is designed to address a specific concern or problem, reducing complexity and improving maintainability.
* **Flexibility**: The architecture is designed to be flexible, allowing for changes and adaptations to be made quickly and easily.
* **Scalability**: The architecture is designed to be scalable, allowing for increased workload and throughput without compromising performance.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the 67. Robust Workflow Architecture consists of the following components:
* **Workflow Definition Layer**: Responsible for defining and configuring workflows, including activities, tasks, and rules.
* **Workflow Execution Layer**: Responsible for executing workflows, including the execution of activities, tasks, and rules.
* **Workflow Monitoring Layer**: Responsible for tracking and analyzing workflow execution, including the collection and analysis of metrics and logs.
* **Workflow Optimization Layer**: Responsible for improving workflow performance and efficiency, including the identification and implementation of improvements.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
The following patterns are commonly used in the 67. Robust Workflow Architecture:
* **Request-Response Pattern**: Used for synchronous communication between layers or components.
* **Event-Driven Pattern**: Used for asynchronous communication between layers or components.
* **Publish-Subscribe Pattern**: Used for decoupling layers or components and enabling loose coupling.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
The following anti-patterns are commonly encountered in workflow architecture:
* **Tight Coupling**: Layers or components are tightly coupled, making it difficult to change or replace one component without affecting others.
* **Monolithic Design**: The architecture is designed as a monolith, with all components or layers tightly integrated and interdependent.
* **Lack of Standardization**: There is a lack of standardization in the architecture, making it difficult to integrate or replace components.
