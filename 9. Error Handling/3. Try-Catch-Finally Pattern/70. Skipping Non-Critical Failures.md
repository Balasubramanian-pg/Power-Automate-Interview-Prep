Canonical documentation for 70. Skipping Non-Critical Failures. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 70. Skipping Non-Critical Failures exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of skipping non-critical failures is to prevent a system or process from halting or failing entirely when encountering a non-essential error or exception. This approach acknowledges that not all failures are equally critical and that, in many cases, it is preferable to continue operating with reduced functionality rather than ceasing to function altogether. The class of problems it addresses includes maintaining system uptime, ensuring continuous service delivery, and managing fault tolerance in complex systems.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of skipping non-critical failures involves categorizing potential failures based on their impact on the system's primary functionality. It then implements mechanisms to detect and bypass or recover from non-critical failures, allowing the system to continue operating, possibly with degraded performance or limited capabilities. This model relies on a deep understanding of system requirements, failure modes, and the trade-offs between reliability, availability, and maintainability.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Non-Critical Failure | A failure that does not significantly impact the primary functionality of a system or process. |
| Critical Failure | A failure that significantly impacts the primary functionality of a system or process, necessitating immediate attention. |
| Fault Tolerance | The ability of a system to continue functioning despite the occurrence of hardware or software failures. |
| Error Handling | Mechanisms and strategies used to detect, report, and recover from errors or exceptions within a system. |
| Degraded Mode | A state in which a system operates with reduced functionality or performance due to one or more non-critical failures. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of skipping non-critical failures include failure classification, fault tolerance strategies, error handling mechanisms, and the implementation of degraded modes of operation. Failure classification involves identifying which failures can be safely skipped without compromising the system's primary objectives. Fault tolerance strategies, such as redundancy and failover, ensure that critical functions remain available. Error handling mechanisms detect and manage failures, and degraded modes allow the system to continue operating, albeit with limitations, when non-critical failures occur.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for skipping non-critical failures typically involves a multi-step process: failure detection, failure classification, decision to skip or not, and recovery or continuation in a degraded mode if necessary. This model emphasizes the importance of monitoring, logging, and analytics in identifying and managing failures. It also underscores the need for clear policies and thresholds that define what constitutes a non-critical failure and under what conditions the system should continue to operate in a degraded state.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in skipping non-critical failures include the use of try-catch blocks in software development to handle exceptions, the implementation of heartbeat signals in distributed systems to detect node failures, and the design of fail-safe defaults that ensure a system reverts to a known good state in the event of a failure. Another pattern is the use of circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures by detecting when a service is not responding and preventing further requests until it becomes available again.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in the context of skipping non-critical failures include ignoring failures altogether, which can lead to unforeseen consequences or system crashes, and overly broad definitions of non-critical failures, which can compromise system integrity. Another anti-pattern is the lack of monitoring and feedback mechanisms, making it difficult to detect when a system is operating in a degraded mode or to understand the impact of skipped failures on system performance and reliability.
