## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 65. Switching Status to Completed Successfully exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of switching status to completed successfully is to provide a clear indication that a task, project, or process has been finished and has met all the required criteria. This exists to address the problem of unclear task status, which can lead to confusion, miscommunication, and delays. By switching the status to completed successfully, individuals and teams can ensure that all stakeholders are informed and that the next steps can be taken.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of switching status to completed successfully involves a state machine that transitions through various stages, including "in progress," "pending review," and finally, "completed successfully." This state machine is often implemented in project management tools, workflows, and business processes to track the progress of tasks and projects.

|------|------------|
| Task | A specific activity or piece of work that needs to be done. |
| Status | The current state of a task, such as "in progress," "pending review," or "completed successfully." |
| State Machine | A mathematical model that can be in one of a finite number of states and can transition between these states based on certain rules. |
| Workflow | A series of tasks or activities that are coordinated and managed to achieve a specific goal. |
| Stakeholder | An individual or group that has an interest or concern in a project or task. |

3. Update the status of the task as it progresses through different stages.
4. Conduct a review or quality assurance check to ensure the task meets the required criteria.
5. Update the status to "completed successfully" when the task is finished and has met all the required criteria.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for switching status to completed successfully include:
* Using project management tools, such as Asana or Trello, to track and update task status.
* Implementing workflows that automate the transition between different states.
* Using notification and communication tools, such as email or Slack, to inform stakeholders when a task is completed successfully.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for switching status to completed successfully include:
* Failing to update the status of a task, leading to confusion and miscommunication.
