Canonical documentation for 72. Parallel Branches in Error Scopes. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 72. Parallel Branches in Error Scopes exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of 72. Parallel Branches in Error Scopes is to provide a framework for handling errors in concurrent systems, where multiple parallel branches of execution may encounter errors. This framework addresses the class of problems related to error handling, fault tolerance, and reliability in distributed and concurrent systems. By providing a structured approach to error handling, 72. Parallel Branches in Error Scopes enables developers to build more robust and resilient systems.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of 72. Parallel Branches in Error Scopes revolves around the idea of error scopes, which are defined as the boundaries within which errors are handled. In a concurrent system, multiple parallel branches of execution may operate within different error scopes. When an error occurs in one branch, it may affect other branches, and the error scope determines how the error is propagated and handled. The model consists of three primary components: error detection, error propagation, and error handling.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Error Scope | A defined boundary within which errors are handled |
| Parallel Branch | A concurrent thread of execution |
| Error Propagation | The process of notifying other branches of an error |
| Error Handling | The process of responding to and recovering from an error |
| Fault Tolerance | The ability of a system to continue operating despite errors |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of 72. Parallel Branches in Error Scopes include:
* Error detection: identifying errors as they occur in each parallel branch
* Error propagation: notifying other branches of errors and determining the error scope
* Error handling: responding to and recovering from errors within the error scope
* Fault tolerance: designing systems to continue operating despite errors

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for 72. Parallel Branches in Error Scopes involves:
1. Defining error scopes for each parallel branch
2. Implementing error detection mechanisms for each branch
3. Establishing error propagation protocols between branches
4. Developing error handling strategies for each error scope
5. Ensuring fault tolerance through redundancy, failovers, or other means

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in 72. Parallel Branches in Error Scopes include:
* Centralized error handling: using a single, centralized component to handle errors
* Decentralized error handling: distributing error handling across multiple components
* Hierarchical error handling: using a hierarchical structure to handle errors

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in 72. Parallel Branches in Error Scopes include:
* Ignoring errors: failing to detect or handle errors
* Overly broad error scopes: defining error scopes that are too large, leading to unnecessary error propagation
* Insufficient fault tolerance: failing to design systems with adequate redundancy or failovers
