Canonical documentation for 74. Scoped Variable Persistence. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 74. Scoped Variable Persistence exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Scoped Variable Persistence exists to address the issue of variable scope and lifetime in programming, particularly in situations where variables need to maintain their state across different scopes or execution contexts. The class of problems it addresses includes issues related to variable initialization, data persistence, and scope-related bugs.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Scoped Variable Persistence refers to the ability of variables to retain their values and state within a specific scope, even when the execution flow leaves or re-enters that scope. This concept is crucial in programming, as it allows developers to write more efficient, modular, and maintainable code.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Scope | A region of the program where a variable is defined and accessible. |
| Variable Persistence | The ability of a variable to retain its value and state across different scopes or execution contexts. |
| Lifetime | The duration for which a variable remains in memory and is accessible. |
| Initialization | The process of assigning an initial value to a variable. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Scoped Variable Persistence include:
* Variable scoping: The rules that govern the accessibility of variables within a program.
* Variable lifetime: The duration for which a variable remains in memory and is accessible.
* Persistence mechanisms: Techniques used to maintain the state of variables across different scopes or execution contexts.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Scoped Variable Persistence involves using a combination of scoping rules, lifetime management, and persistence mechanisms to ensure that variables retain their state and values across different scopes and execution contexts. This model typically includes:
* Block-level scoping: Variables are scoped to the block in which they are defined.
* Function-level scoping: Variables are scoped to the function in which they are defined.
* Module-level scoping: Variables are scoped to the module in which they are defined.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Scoped Variable Persistence include:
* Using local variables to store temporary values.
* Using function parameters to pass values between functions.
* Using module-level variables to store global state.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Scoped Variable Persistence include:
* Using global variables excessively, as this can lead to naming conflicts and tight coupling.
* Using complex scoping rules, as this can lead to confusion and maintenance issues.
* Failing to properly initialize variables, as this can lead to undefined behavior.
