# 54. Designing the Error Notification

Canonical documentation for 54. Designing the Error Notification. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 54. Designing the Error Notification exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of designing error notifications is to effectively communicate errors to users in a way that is clear, concise, and actionable. The problem space includes situations where users encounter errors while interacting with a system, application, or website, and the error notification must provide sufficient information to help the user understand the issue, its cause, and potential solutions.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Error notifications are an essential component of user experience (UX) design, as they help to mitigate the negative impact of errors on the user's interaction with a system. A well-designed error notification should be attention-grabbing, easy to understand, and provide relevant information to facilitate error recovery.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Error | An unexpected condition that occurs during the execution of a program or system, resulting in an unintended behavior or outcome. |
| Error Notification | A message or alert that informs the user of an error, providing information about the error, its cause, and potential solutions. |
| Alert | A visual or auditory cue that draws the user's attention to an error or other important event. |
| Error Message | A text-based description of an error, including its cause, effects, and potential solutions. |
| Error Code | A unique identifier assigned to a specific error, used for debugging, logging, and support purposes. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of designing error notifications include:
* **Clarity**: Error notifications should be easy to understand, using clear and concise language.
* **Relevance**: Error notifications should provide relevant information about the error, its cause, and potential solutions.
* **Timeliness**: Error notifications should be displayed in a timely manner, allowing the user to take corrective action.
* **Consistency**: Error notifications should follow a consistent design pattern, making it easy for users to recognize and understand them.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for designing error notifications includes the following components:
* **Error message**: A brief description of the error, including its cause and effects.
* **Error code**: A unique identifier assigned to the error, used for debugging and support purposes.
* **Solution or recommendation**: A suggested course of action to resolve the error or mitigate its effects.
* **Additional resources**: Optional links or references to additional information, such as user manuals, FAQs, or support websites.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for designing error notifications include:
* **Modal windows**: Error notifications displayed in a modal window, overlaying the main application window.
* **Toast notifications**: Error notifications displayed as a toast or popup, typically in the corner of the screen.
* **Inline error messages**: Error notifications displayed inline, adjacent to the field or control that caused the error.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for designing error notifications include:
* **Cryptic error messages**: Error messages that are unclear, ambiguous, or overly technical.
* **Insufficient information**: Error notifications that do not provide sufficient information about the error, its cause, or potential solutions.
* **Inconsistent design**: Error notifications that do not follow a consistent design pattern, making it difficult for users to recognize and understand them.
