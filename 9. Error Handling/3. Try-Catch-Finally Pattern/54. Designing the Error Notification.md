# 54. Designing the Error Notification

Canonical documentation for [54. Designing the Error Notification](9. Error Handling/3. Try-Catch-Finally Pattern/54. Designing the Error Notification.md). This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
The design of error notifications serves as the critical communication bridge between a system failure and a user's ability to rectify or understand that failure. The primary purpose is to provide immediate, clear, and actionable feedback when a process deviates from its intended path. Effective error notification design minimizes user frustration, prevents data loss, and maintains the integrity of the user experience by transforming a technical breakdown into a guided recovery process.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative, focusing on the psychological and structural requirements of error communication rather than specific code syntax.

## Scope
This documentation covers the conceptual framework, structural requirements, and delivery methods for notifying users of system or input errors.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **In scope:**
> * Taxonomy of error types and severities.
> * Structural components of a notification message.
> * Placement and persistence logic.
> * Accessibility and internationalization requirements.

> [!WARNING]
> **Out of scope:**
> * Specific vendor implementations (e.g., Bootstrap toasts, Material UI snackbars).
> * Backend logging architectures or telemetry gathering.
> * Network protocol specifications (e.g., HTTP status code definitions).

## Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Notification | A visual or auditory signal intended to inform the user of a change in system state. |
| Recovery Path | A specific set of instructions or actions provided to the user to resolve the error. |
| Severity | The classification of an error based on its impact on the system's functionality (e.g., Critical, Warning, Info). |
| Inline Error | A notification placed in direct proximity to the UI element that triggered the error. |
| Modal Error | A high-interruption notification that requires user interaction before any other task can be performed. |
| Transient Notification | A message that appears and disappears automatically without requiring user dismissal. |

## Core Concepts
The design of an error notification is governed by four pillars: **Visibility**, **Clarity**, **Actionability**, and **Empathy**.

1.  **Visibility:** The notification must be impossible to miss but proportionate to the error's severity.
2.  **Clarity:** The language must be human-readable, avoiding technical jargon or internal system codes that provide no value to the end-user.
3.  **Actionability:** Every error notification should ideally answer the question, "What do I do now?"
4.  **Empathy:** The tone should be helpful and neutral, avoiding language that blames the user for the failure.

> [!TIP]
> Think of an error notification like a well-designed road sign during a detour. It doesn't just say "Road Closed" (the error); it points an arrow toward the "Alternative Route" (the recovery path).

## Standard Model
The standard model for an error notification consists of a structured hierarchy of information:

1.  **The Indicator:** A visual cue (icon, color, or sound) that signals the type of error. Red is standard for critical failures, while yellow/amber is used for warnings.
2.  **The Headline:** A brief summary of what went wrong (e.g., "Connection Lost").
3.  **The Body:** A concise explanation of the cause and the impact on the user's current task.
4.  **The Resolution:** A clear call-to-action (CTA) or set of instructions to fix the issue (e.g., "Retry," "Check Settings," or "Contact Support").
5.  **The Identifier:** A unique reference code (for technical support) that is secondary to the human-readable text.

## Common Patterns
*   **The Toast/Snackbar:** Used for non-blocking, system-level errors that do not prevent the user from continuing other tasks.
*   **The Inline Validation:** Used primarily in forms to provide immediate feedback on specific input fields.
*   **The Banner/Callout:** Used for persistent, high-level issues (e.g., "Your subscription has expired") that affect the entire application context.
*   **The Modal Dialog:** Reserved for critical errors that require immediate resolution or acknowledge a destructive action (e.g., "Data could not be saved; please resolve before exiting").

## Anti-Patterns
*   **The "Mystery" Error:** Providing a code (e.g., "Error 0x80045") without any descriptive text.
*   **The Blame Game:** Using accusatory language like "You entered the wrong date" instead of "Please enter a valid date."
*   **The Dead End:** Informing the user of an error but providing no way to close the notification or fix the problem.
*   **Notification Overload:** Triggering multiple notifications for a single root cause (e.g., five separate pop-ups for a single failed form submission).

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid "Ghost Notifications"—errors that appear and disappear so quickly that the user knows something went wrong but cannot read the message or understand how to fix it.

## Edge Cases
*   **Multiple Concurrent Errors:** When a single action triggers multiple errors, the system must decide whether to aggregate them into a summary notification or stack them. Aggregation is generally preferred for usability.
*   **Connectivity Loss:** If the error is a loss of internet connection, the notification system itself may be unable to fetch localized error strings or log the event to a remote server.
*   **Background Failures:** Errors occurring in processes the user cannot see (e.g., a background sync). These require a balance between informing the user and avoiding unnecessary interruption.
*   **Accessibility (A11Y):** Ensuring that screen readers are notified of the error via ARIA live regions (`aria-live="assertive"`) and that color is not the only indicator of the error state.

## Related Topics
*   **User Experience (UX) Design:** The broader discipline of managing user flow and interaction.
*   **Form Validation:** The specific logic used to check user input before submission.
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** The process of translating error messages into different languages and cultural contexts.
*   **System Logging:** The backend counterpart to notifications where technical details are stored for debugging.
