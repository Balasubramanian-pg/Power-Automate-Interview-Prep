Canonical documentation for 59. Emailing Admins on Failure. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 59. Emailing Admins on Failure exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Emailing admins on failure is a critical component of system monitoring and maintenance, designed to notify administrators of system failures, errors, or other critical events that require immediate attention. The primary purpose of this functionality is to ensure timely intervention, minimize downtime, and prevent data loss. The class of problems it addresses includes system crashes, network outages, database errors, and other types of failures that can impact system availability, security, or performance.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of emailing admins on failure involves a simple yet effective mechanism: when a system failure or critical event occurs, the system generates an email notification that is sent to designated administrators. This notification typically includes essential details about the failure, such as the type of error, the affected system or component, and any relevant troubleshooting information. The goal is to provide administrators with the information they need to quickly identify and resolve the issue, thereby minimizing the impact on the system and its users.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Notification | A message or alert sent to administrators to inform them of a system failure or critical event. |
| Administrator | An individual or group responsible for managing and maintaining a system, including troubleshooting and resolving failures. |
| Failure | A system crash, error, or other critical event that impacts system availability, security, or performance. |
| Email Template | A pre-defined format for email notifications, including the layout, content, and style of the message. |
| Escalation Procedure | A predefined process for escalating notifications to higher-level administrators or support teams in the event of a critical failure. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of emailing admins on failure include:
* **Notification**: The process of sending email notifications to administrators in response to system failures or critical events.
* **Email Configuration**: The setup and configuration of email settings, including the email server, sender and recipient addresses, and email templates.
* **Failure Detection**: The mechanism for detecting system failures or critical events, such as error logging, monitoring tools, or system checks.
* **Escalation**: The process of escalating notifications to higher-level administrators or support teams in the event of a critical failure.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for emailing admins on failure typically involves the following components:
* **Failure Detection**: A monitoring system or error logging mechanism that detects system failures or critical events.
* **Notification Service**: A service or module that generates and sends email notifications to administrators in response to detected failures.
* **Email Template**: A pre-defined email template that includes essential details about the failure, such as the type of error, affected system or component, and troubleshooting information.
* **Escalation Procedure**: A predefined process for escalating notifications to higher-level administrators or support teams in the event of a critical failure.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for emailing admins on failure include:
* **Simple Notification**: Sending a basic email notification to administrators with details about the failure.
* **Customizable Templates**: Using customizable email templates to include specific details about the failure, such as error messages or system logs.
* **Escalation Procedures**: Establishing escalation procedures to ensure that critical failures are promptly addressed by higher-level administrators or support teams.
* **Notification Filtering**: Implementing notification filtering to reduce noise and ensure that administrators only receive relevant and actionable notifications.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for emailing admins on failure include:
* **Over-Notification**: Sending too many notifications, resulting in notification fatigue and decreased responsiveness from administrators.
* **Insufficient Information**: Failing to include essential details about the failure, making it difficult for administrators to troubleshoot and resolve the issue.
* **Inadequate Escalation**: Failing to establish adequate escalation procedures, resulting in critical failures being overlooked or not addressed in a timely manner.
* **Poor Email Configuration**: Failing to properly configure email settings, resulting in notifications being lost, delayed, or misdirected.
