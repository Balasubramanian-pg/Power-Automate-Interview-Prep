# 52. Boolean Flags in Error Logic

Canonical documentation for 52. Boolean Flags in Error Logic. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 52. Boolean Flags in Error Logic exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Boolean Flags in Error Logic is to provide a standardized approach to handling and managing error conditions in software systems. Boolean flags are used to indicate the occurrence of an error or exception, allowing the system to take corrective action or notify the user. The problem space addressed by Boolean Flags in Error Logic includes error detection, error handling, and error reporting.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Boolean Flags in Error Logic involve the use of boolean variables to track error conditions in a system. These flags are typically set to true when an error occurs and reset to false when the error is cleared. The flags can be used to trigger error handling mechanisms, such as logging, notification, or correction.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Boolean Flag | A boolean variable used to indicate the occurrence of an error or exception. |
| Error Condition | A state or situation that prevents the system from functioning correctly. |
| Error Handling | The process of detecting, reporting, and correcting errors in a system. |
| Flag State | The current value of a boolean flag, either true or false. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Boolean Flags in Error Logic include:
* Error detection: identifying when an error occurs
* Error reporting: notifying the system or user of an error
* Error handling: taking corrective action to resolve the error
* Flag management: setting, clearing, and checking boolean flags

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Boolean Flags in Error Logic involves:
1. Defining a set of boolean flags to track error conditions
2. Setting the flags to true when an error occurs
3. Using the flags to trigger error handling mechanisms
4. Clearing the flags when the error is resolved

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Boolean Flags in Error Logic include:
* Using a single flag to track a specific error condition
* Using multiple flags to track different error conditions
* Using flags to trigger logging or notification mechanisms
* Using flags to enable or disable system features

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Boolean Flags in Error Logic include:
* Using boolean flags to track non-error conditions
* Failing to clear flags after an error is resolved
* Using flags to implement complex logic or business rules
* Ignoring or neglecting error handling mechanisms
