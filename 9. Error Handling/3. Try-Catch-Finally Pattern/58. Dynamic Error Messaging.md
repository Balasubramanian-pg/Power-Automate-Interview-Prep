# 58. Dynamic Error Messaging

Canonical documentation for 58. Dynamic Error Messaging. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 58. Dynamic Error Messaging exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Dynamic Error Messaging is to provide a flexible and customizable way to handle and display error messages in applications, allowing for a more personalized and user-friendly experience. The problem space it addresses includes the need for applications to handle errors in a way that is both informative and non-intrusive, providing users with clear and concise information about what went wrong and how to recover.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Dynamic Error Messaging is based on the idea of decoupling error messages from the application's business logic, allowing for a more modular and maintainable approach to error handling. This involves defining a set of error message templates, which can be populated with dynamic data and displayed to the user in a variety of formats, such as alerts, notifications, or inline messages.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Error Message | A message that informs the user of an error or exception that has occurred in the application. |
| Error Template | A predefined template for displaying error messages, which can be populated with dynamic data. |
| Dynamic Data | Data that is generated or retrieved at runtime, used to populate error message templates. |
| Error Severity | A classification of the severity of an error, such as warning, error, or critical. |
| Error Code | A unique identifier for a specific error or exception, used for logging and debugging purposes. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Dynamic Error Messaging include:
* **Error Message Templating**: Defining reusable templates for error messages, which can be populated with dynamic data.
* **Dynamic Data Binding**: Binding dynamic data to error message templates, allowing for personalized and context-specific error messages.
* **Error Severity Classification**: Classifying errors by severity, allowing for different handling and display strategies.
* **Error Code Management**: Managing unique error codes for logging, debugging, and analytics purposes.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Dynamic Error Messaging involves the following components:
* **Error Message Service**: A centralized service responsible for managing error message templates, dynamic data, and error severity classification.
* **Error Message Renderer**: A component responsible for rendering error messages, using the error message templates and dynamic data.
* **Error Handler**: A component responsible for handling errors, logging error codes, and triggering error messages.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Dynamic Error Messaging include:
* **Error Message Localization**: Using localized error message templates to support multiple languages and regions.
* **Error Message Personalization**: Using dynamic data to personalize error messages, such as addressing the user by name.
* **Error Message Prioritization**: Prioritizing error messages based on severity, to ensure that critical errors are displayed prominently.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Dynamic Error Messaging include:
* **Hardcoded Error Messages**: Hardcoding error messages, making it difficult to maintain and update them.
* **Error Message Duplication**: Duplicating error message templates, leading to inconsistencies and maintenance issues.
* **Insufficient Error Logging**: Failing to log error codes and dynamic data, making it difficult to diagnose and debug issues.
