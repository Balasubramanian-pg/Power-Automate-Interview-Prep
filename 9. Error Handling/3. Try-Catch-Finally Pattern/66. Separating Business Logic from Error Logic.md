# 66. Separating Business Logic from Error Logic

Canonical documentation for 66. Separating Business Logic from Error Logic. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 66. Separating Business Logic from Error Logic exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Separating business logic from error logic is a fundamental concept in software development that aims to improve code maintainability, readability, and scalability. It addresses the problem of tightly coupled code, where business logic and error handling are intertwined, making it difficult to modify or extend the codebase. By separating these concerns, developers can focus on writing clean, efficient, and robust code that is easier to understand and maintain.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of separating business logic from error logic involves dividing the code into distinct layers or components, each responsible for a specific concern. The business logic layer focuses on the core functionality of the application, while the error logic layer handles exceptions, errors, and edge cases. This separation enables developers to write business logic that is decoupled from error handling, making it easier to test, debug, and maintain.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Business Logic | The core functionality of an application that performs calculations, processes data, and implements business rules. |
| Error Logic | The code responsible for handling exceptions, errors, and edge cases, ensuring that the application remains stable and provides meaningful feedback to users. |
| Separation of Concerns | A design principle that involves dividing a system into distinct components, each addressing a specific concern, to improve maintainability, scalability, and reusability. |
| Decoupling | The process of reducing dependencies between components or layers, making it easier to modify or replace individual parts without affecting the entire system. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of separating business logic from error logic include:
* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each component or layer should have a single, well-defined responsibility, making it easier to maintain and extend.
* **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**: Divide the system into distinct components, each addressing a specific concern, to improve maintainability and scalability.
* **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions, errors, and edge cases, ensuring that the application remains stable and provides meaningful feedback to users.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for separating business logic from error logic involves the following layers:
* **Presentation Layer**: Handles user input, displays output, and provides a user interface.
* **Business Logic Layer**: Performs calculations, processes data, and implements business rules.
* **Error Logic Layer**: Handles exceptions, errors, and edge cases, ensuring that the application remains stable and provides meaningful feedback to users.
* **Data Access Layer**: Manages data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for separating business logic from error logic include:
* **Try-Catch Blocks**: Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and errors, keeping the business logic layer clean and focused on core functionality.
* **Error Handling Mechanisms**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms, such as logging, notification, and feedback systems, to ensure that the application remains stable and provides meaningful feedback to users.
* **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**: Use AOP to separate cross-cutting concerns, such as error handling, from the business logic layer.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for separating business logic from error logic include:
* **Tight Coupling**: Intertwining business logic and error handling, making it difficult to modify or extend the codebase.
* **God Object**: Creating a single, monolithic object that handles all concerns, including business logic and error handling.
* **Error Handling in Business Logic**: Handling errors and exceptions within the business logic layer, making it difficult to maintain and extend.
