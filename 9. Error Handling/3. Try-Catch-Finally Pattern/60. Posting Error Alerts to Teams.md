Canonical documentation for 60. Posting Error Alerts to Teams. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 60. Posting Error Alerts to Teams exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of posting error alerts to Teams is to provide real-time notifications to development teams, operations teams, or other stakeholders when errors occur in software applications, services, or systems. This addresses the problem of delayed error detection, which can lead to prolonged downtime, data loss, or other negative consequences. By posting error alerts to Teams, teams can quickly identify and respond to errors, reducing the mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to resolve (MTTR).

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of posting error alerts to Teams involves integrating error monitoring and logging tools with Microsoft Teams, a communication and collaboration platform. This integration enables the automatic posting of error alerts to designated Teams channels, where team members can receive notifications, discuss, and take action to resolve the errors.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Error Alert | A notification sent to Teams when an error occurs in a software application, service, or system. |
| Teams Channel | A dedicated space in Microsoft Teams where team members can communicate, share files, and receive notifications. |
| Webhook | A callback function that sends an HTTP request to a specified URL, used to integrate error monitoring tools with Teams. |
| Connector | A service that enables integration between error monitoring tools and Teams, allowing for the posting of error alerts. |
| Notification | A message sent to team members in a Teams channel, informing them of an error alert. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of posting error alerts to Teams include:
* Error monitoring: The process of detecting and logging errors in software applications, services, or systems.
* Integration: The connection between error monitoring tools and Teams, enabling the automatic posting of error alerts.
* Notification: The process of sending alerts to team members in a Teams channel, informing them of errors.
* Collaboration: The ability of team members to discuss and take action to resolve errors within the Teams channel.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for posting error alerts to Teams involves the following steps:
1. Error detection: Error monitoring tools detect errors in software applications, services, or systems.
2. Integration: Error monitoring tools integrate with Teams using webhooks or connectors.
3. Notification: Error alerts are posted to designated Teams channels, notifying team members of errors.
4. Collaboration: Team members discuss and take action to resolve errors within the Teams channel.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for posting error alerts to Teams include:
* Using webhooks to integrate error monitoring tools with Teams.
* Creating dedicated Teams channels for error alerts and notifications.
* Customizing error alert notifications to include relevant information, such as error messages and timestamps.
* Using connectors to integrate error monitoring tools with Teams, enabling bi-directional communication.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for posting error alerts to Teams include:
* Overwhelming team members with excessive error alerts, leading to notification fatigue.
* Failing to customize error alert notifications, resulting in irrelevant or unactionable information.
* Not providing clear escalation procedures or runbooks for error resolution.
* Ignoring or dismissing error alerts, rather than taking prompt action to resolve errors.
