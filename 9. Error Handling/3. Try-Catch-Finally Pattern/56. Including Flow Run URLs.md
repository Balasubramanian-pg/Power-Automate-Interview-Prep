# 56. Including Flow Run URLs

Canonical documentation for 56. Including Flow Run URLs. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 56. Including Flow Run URLs exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of including Flow Run URLs is to provide a standardized way to reference and track the execution of workflows, enabling better monitoring, debugging, and auditing of complex business processes. This addresses the problem of lacking visibility and accountability in workflow execution, which can lead to errors, inefficiencies, and security vulnerabilities.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of including Flow Run URLs involves a workflow management system that generates a unique URL for each execution of a workflow, allowing users to access and monitor the workflow's progress, inputs, outputs, and any errors that may occur. This model assumes a decentralized and distributed architecture, where workflows can be executed across multiple systems, services, and organizations.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Flow Run | A single execution of a workflow, which can be instantiated multiple times with different inputs and parameters. |
| Flow Run URL | A unique URL that references a specific Flow Run, providing access to its execution history, logs, and artifacts. |
| Workflow | A predefined sequence of tasks, actions, or operations that are executed in a specific order to achieve a business goal or process. |
| Workflow Management System | A software system that manages the execution of workflows, including Flow Runs, and provides features such as monitoring, logging, and error handling. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of including Flow Run URLs are:
* **Unique identification**: Each Flow Run is assigned a unique URL that can be used to reference and access its execution history.
* **Decentralized execution**: Workflows can be executed across multiple systems, services, and organizations, requiring a standardized way to reference and track their execution.
* **Monitoring and debugging**: Flow Run URLs provide a way to monitor and debug workflow execution, enabling users to identify and resolve errors, bottlenecks, and other issues.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for including Flow Run URLs involves the following components:
* **Workflow management system**: A software system that manages the execution of workflows and generates unique URLs for each Flow Run.
* **Flow Run repository**: A centralized repository that stores information about each Flow Run, including its execution history, logs, and artifacts.
* **URL generator**: A component that generates unique URLs for each Flow Run, based on a standardized naming convention.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for including Flow Run URLs include:
* **Logging and auditing**: Using Flow Run URLs to log and audit workflow execution, providing a tamper-evident record of all changes and actions.
* **Error handling**: Using Flow Run URLs to handle errors and exceptions, providing a way to diagnose and resolve issues that occur during workflow execution.
* **Monitoring and analytics**: Using Flow Run URLs to monitor and analyze workflow execution, providing insights into performance, efficiency, and effectiveness.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for including Flow Run URLs include:
* **Hardcoding URLs**: Hardcoding Flow Run URLs into workflows or applications, rather than generating them dynamically.
* **Using non-unique identifiers**: Using non-unique identifiers, such as workflow names or IDs, to reference Flow Runs, rather than unique URLs.
* **Not storing Flow Run history**: Not storing information about each Flow Run, including its execution history, logs, and artifacts, making it difficult to monitor, debug, and audit workflow execution.
