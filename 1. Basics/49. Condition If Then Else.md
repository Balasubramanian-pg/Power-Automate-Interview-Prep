# 49. Condition If Then Else

Canonical documentation for 49. Condition If Then Else. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
The "If-Then-Else" construct exists to provide **conditional control flow** within an algorithm or system. It addresses the requirement for a system to exhibit different behaviors based on varying inputs or states. By evaluating a specific criterion (the condition), the system can diverge from a linear execution path, ensuring that only the logic relevant to the current context is executed.

## Scope
Clarify what is in scope and out of scope for this topic.

**In scope:**
* **Logical Branching:** The fundamental mechanism of diverting execution paths.
* **Boolean Evaluation:** The process of determining the truth value of a predicate.
* **Structural Hierarchy:** The relationship between primary, alternative, and default branches.
* **Execution Guarantees:** The principle of mutual exclusivity in standard conditional branching.

**Out of scope:**
* **Specific Syntax:** Language-specific keywords (e.g., `elif`, `elsif`, `case`).
* **Hardware-level Branch Prediction:** Low-level CPU optimization techniques.
* **Pattern Matching:** Complex structural decomposition (though related, this is a distinct topic).

## Definitions
Provide precise definitions for key terms.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Predicate** | A logical expression that evaluates to a Boolean value (True or False). |
| **Branch** | A discrete block of logic or instructions associated with a specific outcome of a predicate. |
| **Consequent** | The branch executed if the predicate evaluates to True (the "Then" block). |
| **Alternative** | The branch executed if the predicate evaluates to False (the "Else" block). |
| **Chaining** | The sequential linking of multiple predicates where each is evaluated only if the preceding ones were False. |
| **Short-Circuiting** | A behavior where the evaluation of a complex predicate stops as soon as the final Boolean outcome is determined. |

## Core Concepts

### 1. Binary Decision Making
At its core, the If-Then-Else construct represents a binary fork in logic. A system encounters a state, evaluates it against a defined rule, and selects exactly one of two paths.

### 2. Mutual Exclusivity
In a standard If-Then-Else structure, branches are mutually exclusive. If the "Then" branch is executed, the "Else" branch is guaranteed not to execute, and vice versa. This ensures deterministic behavior.

### 3. Sequential Evaluation
In multi-branch structures (If-Then-Else-If), predicates are evaluated in a top-down, sequential order. The first predicate that evaluates to True triggers its associated branch, and all subsequent branches in that specific chain are ignored, regardless of their truth value.

### 4. The Default Case
The "Else" component serves as a catch-all or "default" state. It ensures that the system has a defined behavior even when none of the specific conditions are met, preventing undefined states in the logic flow.

## Standard Model

The standard model for conditional branching follows a hierarchical structure:

1.  **IF (Predicate):** The entry point. The predicate is evaluated first.
2.  **THEN (Consequent):** If the predicate is True, this block executes. Execution then jumps to the end of the entire conditional structure.
3.  **ELSE IF (Optional Predicate):** Evaluated only if all preceding predicates were False. Multiple "Else If" blocks can exist.
4.  **ELSE (Alternative):** The final fallback. Executes only if all preceding "If" and "Else If" predicates evaluated to False.

## Common Patterns

### Guard Clauses
A pattern where "If" statements are used to handle edge cases or error conditions at the beginning of a process, often resulting in an early exit (return or break). This reduces the need for deeply nested "Else" blocks.

### Ternary Expressions
A condensed form of If-Then-Else used to return one of two values based on a condition. It is typically used for assignments rather than complex flow control.

### Null Coalescing/Checking
A specific application of conditional logic used to provide a default value when a variable or object is found to be null or uninitialized.

## Anti-Patterns

### Arrow Code (Deep Nesting)
The practice of nesting multiple If-Then-Else blocks within one another, creating a "shape" in the code that moves horizontally. This significantly reduces readability and increases cognitive load.

### Redundant Else
Including an "Else" block after a "Then" block that already terminates the execution flow (e.g., via a `return` or `throw`). This adds unnecessary complexity to the logic structure.

### Side-Effect Predicates
Including logic within the predicate evaluation that changes the state of the system. Predicates should ideally be "pure" (read-only) to ensure that the act of checking a condition does not inadvertently alter the system's behavior.

### Over-Conditioning
Using If-Then-Else chains to handle a large number of discrete values (e.g., checking if a variable is 1, then 2, then 3...). In such cases, a "Switch" or "Lookup Table" model is generally preferred.

## Edge Cases

### Truthiness vs. Boolean Strictness
In many systems, non-boolean values (integers, strings, objects) can be evaluated in a condition. Defining what constitutes "True" (e.g., non-zero, non-empty) is a critical edge case that varies by implementation.

### The Dangling Else
A scenario in nested conditions where it is ambiguous which "If" an "Else" belongs to. Standard models resolve this by associating the "Else" with the nearest preceding "If" that does not already have an "Else."

### Short-Circuit Side Effects
If a predicate relies on multiple conditions (e.g., `A AND B`), and `A` is False, `B` is never evaluated. If `B` was intended to perform a necessary operation, that operation will fail to occur.
