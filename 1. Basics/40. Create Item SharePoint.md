# 40. Create Item SharePoint

Canonical documentation for 40. Create Item SharePoint. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
The "Create Item" operation in SharePoint serves as the primary mechanism for data persistence within a SharePoint List. It addresses the need to transform transient data—originating from user input, external systems, or automated workflows—into a structured, governed, and versioned record. This operation ensures that data adheres to a predefined schema (the List definition) while inheriting the security and compliance posture of the host environment.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative, focusing on the logical transaction of item creation rather than specific UI or SDK instructions.

## Scope
Clarify what is in scope and out of scope for this topic.

**In scope:**
* The logical transaction of adding a new record to a SharePoint List.
* Schema validation and metadata requirements.
* Permission requirements for item creation.
* The relationship between the data payload and the target list structure.

**Out of scope:**
* Specific vendor implementations (e.g., Power Automate "Create Item" card vs. PnP PowerShell vs. Microsoft Graph API).
* Document library "Upload" operations (which involve file streams).
* Configuration of List settings or column creation.

## Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **List** | A collection of data organized in rows (items) and columns (fields) within a SharePoint site. |
| **Item** | A single entry or record within a List, representing a discrete unit of information. |
| **Internal Name** | The immutable, system-level identifier for a column, used during the creation process to map data. |
| **Schema** | The structural definition of the List, including column types, requirements, and constraints. |
| **Payload** | The set of data values sent to the SharePoint service to populate the new item. |
| **Lookup Field** | A column type that references an existing item in a different list. |

## Core Concepts
### Schema Adherence
Every "Create Item" operation must conform to the target List's schema. This includes data type matching (e.g., ensuring a date string is sent to a Date/Time column) and satisfying "Required" field constraints.

### Identity and Metadata
Upon successful creation, the system automatically generates immutable metadata for the item, including a unique **ID** (integer), a **GUID**, a **Created Date**, and an **Author** (Created By). These fields cannot be defined by the requester during a standard creation event.

### Transactional Integrity
The creation of an item is an atomic operation. If the payload fails validation for a single required field or violates a column constraint (such as a unique value requirement), the entire operation fails, and no partial record is created.

## Standard Model
The standard model for creating an item follows a Request-Response pattern:

1.  **Target Identification:** The requester specifies the destination via a Site URL and a List Identifier (Title, GUID, or Relative URL).
2.  **Payload Construction:** The requester assembles a key-value pair collection where keys correspond to the **Internal Names** of the columns.
3.  **Authentication & Authorization:** The system verifies that the requester possesses `AddListItems` permissions (typically included in the "Contribute" or "Edit" permission levels).
4.  **Validation:** The SharePoint engine validates the payload against the List schema.
5.  **Commitment:** The item is written to the database, and system metadata is assigned.
6.  **Response:** The system returns the full object of the created item, including the newly assigned ID.

## Common Patterns
*   **Default Value Leveraging:** Omitting non-required fields in the payload to allow the SharePoint List's default values to populate the record.
*   **Lookup Mapping:** Providing the integer ID of a related item when populating Lookup or Person columns.
*   **System-Triggered Creation:** Utilizing the creation event to initiate secondary processes, such as Power Automate flows or webhooks.

## Anti-Patterns
*   **Using Display Names:** Attempting to create items using the "Display Name" of a column rather than the "Internal Name." Display names are mutable and can lead to request failures if changed.
*   **Hardcoding IDs:** Assuming a specific ID will be assigned to a new item. IDs are incremental and managed by the system; they should never be predicted.
*   **Over-fetching Post-Creation:** Performing a second "Get Item" request immediately after creation to retrieve the ID, rather than capturing the ID from the initial creation response.
*   **Ignoring Throttling:** Sending high-frequency creation requests without implementing exponential backoff, leading to 429 (Too Many Requests) errors.

## Edge Cases
*   **Large List Resource Quotas:** Creating items in a list exceeding 5,000 items (the List View Threshold) is generally permitted, but subsequent indexing or filtered views may fail if not configured correctly.
*   **Multi-Value Fields:** Creating items with multi-select choice or lookup fields requires a specific array-based payload structure that differs from single-value fields.
*   **Field-Level Security:** In scenarios where specific fields are hidden or read-only via custom forms, the underlying "Create Item" API may still allow data submission unless restricted by custom validation logic or specific permissions.
*   **Draft/Minor Versions:** If a list requires content approval, the "Create Item" operation may result in a "Pending" or "Draft" state, making the item invisible to users with only "Read" access.

## Related Topics
*   **41. Update Item SharePoint:** The subsequent modification of an existing record.
*   **42. Delete Item SharePoint:** The removal of a record from the active list.
*   **Schema Validation:** The logic governing data integrity within SharePoint.
*   **SharePoint REST API / Microsoft Graph:** The primary interfaces for executing the Create Item operation programmatically.
