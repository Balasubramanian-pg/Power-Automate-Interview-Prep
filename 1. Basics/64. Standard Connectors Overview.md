# 64. Standard Connectors Overview

Canonical documentation for 64. Standard Connectors Overview. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
The purpose of Standard Connectors is to provide a unified, reusable interface for facilitating communication between disparate software systems. In modern distributed architectures, systems often rely on different protocols, data formats, and security requirements. Standard Connectors abstract this underlying complexity, allowing developers and architects to focus on business logic rather than the intricacies of point-to-point integration. They address the problem of "integration sprawl" by providing a consistent framework for data ingress, egress, and synchronization.

> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative.

## Scope
Clarify what is in scope and out of scope for this topic.

**In scope:**
* **Abstraction Layers:** The theoretical framework for decoupling systems.
* **Protocol Standardization:** Common methods for data transport (e.g., REST, SOAP, JDBC).
* **Lifecycle Management:** The general stages of a connector from configuration to retirement.
* **Security Paradigms:** Standardized authentication and authorization patterns within connectors.

**Out of scope:**
* **Specific vendor implementations:** Proprietary connectors for specific SaaS platforms or cloud providers.
* **Code-level SDKs:** Language-specific implementation details.
* **Hardware connectors:** Physical cabling or hardware interfaces.

## Definitions
Provide precise definitions for key terms.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Connector** | A software component that encapsulates the logic required to interact with a specific resource or service. |
| **Protocol** | A standardized set of rules for data transmission between two nodes (e.g., HTTP, MQTT, AMQP). |
| **Adapter** | A sub-component of a connector that translates internal data structures into the format required by the target system. |
| **Payload** | The actual data transmitted by the connector, excluding headers and metadata. |
| **Endpoint** | The specific destination or entry point for a connector's communication. |
| **Schema** | The structural definition of the data being exchanged through a connector. |

## Core Concepts

### 1. Abstraction of Complexity
Standard connectors serve as a "black box" for integration. The consumer of a connector should not need to understand the low-level API calls, retry logic, or header requirements of the target system.

### 2. Reusability and Portability
A standard connector is designed to be used across multiple projects and environments. By adhering to a standard model, a connector built for one workflow should be functionally identical when deployed in another, provided the configuration parameters are updated.

### 3. Connectivity Tiers
Connectors are generally categorized by their function:
*   **Protocol Connectors:** Generic interfaces for standard protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP).
*   **Application Connectors:** Specialized interfaces designed for specific software applications.
*   **Data Connectors:** Optimized for high-volume data movement and database interactions.

### 4. Security Encapsulation
Standard connectors must manage security contexts, including credential storage, token refresh cycles, and encryption of data in transit, without exposing sensitive details to the broader application logic.

## Standard Model
The standard model for a connector consists of four distinct layers:

1.  **Transport Layer:** Manages the physical or virtual connection (e.g., TCP/IP, TLS).
2.  **Protocol Layer:** Handles the communication rules (e.g., RESTful verbs, SOAP envelopes).
3.  **Transformation Layer:** Maps internal data models to the target system's schema and vice versa.
4.  **Interaction Layer:** Defines the triggers (events that start the connector) and actions (operations the connector performs).

## Common Patterns

### Request-Response
The most common pattern where a connector sends a query or command and waits for a synchronous acknowledgment or data return.

### Webhooks (Push)
The connector acts as a listener, waiting for the external system to push data to a specific endpoint when an event occurs.

### Polling (Pull)
The connector periodically checks the target system for new or updated data based on a defined schedule or interval.

### Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub)
The connector interacts with a message broker to broadcast messages to multiple subscribers or listen for messages on a specific topic.

## Anti-Patterns

*   **Hardcoding Credentials:** Embedding authentication details directly within the connector logic rather than using a secure configuration provider.
*   **Tight Coupling:** Designing a connector that is so specific to a single use case that it cannot be reused for other instances of the same target system.
*   **Ignoring Rate Limits:** Failing to implement throttling or back-off logic, leading to service disruptions or IP blacklisting by the target system.
*   **Monolithic Connectors:** Attempting to build a single connector that handles too many disparate functions, making maintenance and debugging difficult.

## Edge Cases

*   **Large Payload Handling:** When the data being transferred exceeds memory limits, requiring the connector to implement streaming or "chunking" mechanisms.
*   **Intermittent Connectivity:** Scenarios where the target system is frequently offline, requiring robust "store-and-forward" or dead-letter queue logic.
*   **Schema Evolution:** Handling situations where the target system updates its data structure without prior notice, necessitating versioning or flexible mapping within the connector.
*   **Bi-directional Synchronization:** Managing race conditions and data conflicts when two systems are updated simultaneously through the same connector framework.

## Related Topics

*   **72. Data Transformation and Mapping:** The logic used within the Transformation Layer of a connector.
*   **12. Authentication Frameworks:** The underlying security protocols (OAuth2, SAML) used by connectors.
