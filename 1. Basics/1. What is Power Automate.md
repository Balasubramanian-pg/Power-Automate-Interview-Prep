# 1. What is Power Automate

Canonical documentation for 1. What is Power Automate. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
Power Automate is a service designed to orchestrate and automate workflows across disparate applications and services. It addresses the "efficiency gap" in modern business operations by allowing users to synchronize files, get notifications, collect data, and automate repetitive manual tasks without requiring extensive custom code.

The primary goal of the platform is to democratize automation, enabling both professional developers and business users (citizen developers) to create secure, scalable, and integrated process logic that bridges the gap between legacy systems and modern cloud-based services.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative, focusing on the architectural and functional nature of the service.

## Scope
**In scope:**
* **Digital Process Automation (DPA):** API-based integration and workflow orchestration.
* **Robotic Process Automation (RPA):** UI-based automation for legacy or non-API systems (Desktop flows).
* **Process Mining:** Analysis of business processes to identify automation opportunities.
* **Business Process Management (BPM):** Structured, multi-stage human-in-the-loop workflows.
* **Connectivity Framework:** The theoretical model for how the service interacts with external data sources.

**Out of scope:**
* Specific licensing costs or commercial packaging.
* Step-by-step tutorials for specific third-party integrations.
* Detailed code-level documentation for the underlying Azure Logic Apps engine.

## Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Flow** | The primary container for an automated logic sequence. |
| **Trigger** | The specific event (manual, scheduled, or automated) that initiates a flow. |
| **Action** | A discrete task or operation performed within a flow after it has been triggered. |
| **Connector** | A proxy or wrapper around an API that allows the service to communicate with an external application. |
| **Environment** | A container used to store, manage, and share an organization's business data, apps, and flows. |
| **DPA** | Digital Process Automation; automation relying on modern API communication. |
| **RPA** | Robotic Process Automation; automation that mimics human interaction with a user interface. |
| **Solution** | A distribution mechanism used to transport flows and related components across environments. |

## Core Concepts
### 1. Event-Driven Architecture
Power Automate operates on an event-driven model. Every workflow is dormant until a predefined "Trigger" occurs. These triggers can be **Polling** (checking for data at intervals) or **Webhook-based** (receiving data instantly when an event occurs).

### 2. Declarative Logic
The platform utilizes a declarative approach to programming. Users define *what* the process should do through a visual designer, and the underlying engine handles the *how* (execution, retry logic, and state management).

### 3. Data Transformation and Expressions
While visual-first, the service includes a robust expression language (based on Workflow Definition Language) that allows for complex data manipulation, mathematical calculations, and string operations.

### 4. Extensibility
The platform is designed to be extensible. When pre-built connectors are insufficient, users can develop **Custom Connectors** to interface with any service that exposes a RESTful API.

## Standard Model
The standard model for Power Automate follows a linear or branched execution path:

1.  **The Trigger Layer:** The entry point (e.g., a new email, a button click, or a timer).
2.  **The Logic Layer:** Conditional statements (If/Then), Switches, and Loops (Apply to Each, Do Until) that govern the flow's direction.
3.  **The Action Layer:** The execution of tasks (e.g., updating a database, sending a message, or generating a document).
4.  **The Connection Layer:** The authenticated security context through which the flow interacts with external services.

## Common Patterns
*   **Human-in-the-Loop (Approvals):** A pattern where a process pauses for human intervention or validation before proceeding.
*   **Data Synchronization:** Moving and transforming data between two different systems to ensure parity.
*   **Automated Notifications:** Monitoring a system for specific conditions and alerting stakeholders via different communication channels.
*   **Scheduled Batch Processing:** Executing high-volume tasks during off-peak hours (e.g., nightly report generation).

## Anti-Patterns
*   **The "God Flow":** Creating a single, massive flow that handles too many unrelated business processes, leading to maintenance difficulties and high failure rates.
*   **Hardcoding Configurations:** Placing environment-specific values (like URLs or IDs) directly in actions rather than using Environment Variables.
*   **Infinite Loops:** Designing flows that trigger themselves (e.g., a flow that updates a record, which then triggers the same flow to run again).
*   **RPA-First Approach:** Using UI-based Robotic Process Automation when a stable API (DPA) is available. RPA is more brittle and should be a secondary choice.

## Edge Cases
*   **Throttling and Limits:** High-frequency flows may hit "Request Limits," requiring optimization of the logic or distribution across multiple flows.
*   **Long-Running Workflows:** Flows that wait for human approval can stay active for up to 30 days. Beyond this, the state must be persisted in an external database to be resumed.
*   **Transient Failures:** Temporary network outages in external services can cause flow failures. Implementing "Retry Policies" is essential for resilience.
*   **Large Payload Handling:** Processing very large files or datasets may exceed the memory limits of the standard engine, requiring "Chunking" or offloading to specialized services.

## Related Topics
*   **Power Apps:** The user interface layer often used to trigger flows or display flow outputs.
*   **Dataverse:** The primary relational data store designed for use with Power Automate.
*   **Azure Logic Apps:** The enterprise-grade workflow engine upon which Power Automate is built.
*   **Power BI:** Used for visualizing the performance and outcomes of automated processes.
