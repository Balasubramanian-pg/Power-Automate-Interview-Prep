# 8. Core Value Proposition Overview

Canonical documentation for 8. Core Value Proposition Overview. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
The Core Value Proposition (CVP) serves as the foundational logic for why a system, product, or service exists. It defines the unique intersection between a stakeholder’s unmet needs and the specific capabilities provided by the solution. The purpose of this topic is to provide a standardized framework for articulating value, ensuring that technical development remains aligned with strategic objectives and user requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative.

## Scope
Clarify what is in scope and out of scope for this topic.

**In scope:**
* Theoretical frameworks for defining value (e.g., Jobs-to-be-Done, Value Proposition Canvas).
* The relationship between pain points, gain creators, and system features.
* Criteria for validating a value proposition.
* Alignment between technical architecture and value delivery.

**Out of scope:**
* Specific marketing or sales messaging strategies.
* Pricing models or revenue generation tactics.
* Vendor-specific product roadmaps.

## Definitions
Provide precise definitions for key terms.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Value Proposition** | A clear statement that explains how a product solves a problem, delivers specific benefits, and tells the target stakeholder why they should choose this solution over alternatives. |
| **Pain Point** | A specific problem, frustration, or challenge faced by a stakeholder that a system intends to mitigate. |
| **Gain Creator** | A feature or capability that produces a positive outcome or benefit for the stakeholder, exceeding their basic expectations. |
| **Job-to-be-Done (JTBD)** | The fundamental task or objective a stakeholder is trying to accomplish in a given context. |
| **Value Exchange** | The transaction where a stakeholder provides resources (time, money, data) in return for the perceived benefits of the system. |
| **Product-Market Fit** | The degree to which a system satisfies a strong market demand or solves a critical organizational need. |

## Core Concepts

### The Value Triad
The Core Value Proposition is built upon three pillars:
1.  **Relevancy:** How the solution addresses specific stakeholder challenges.
2.  **Quantified Value:** The measurable benefits (efficiency, cost reduction, risk mitigation) delivered by the solution.
3.  **Differentiation:** The unique attributes that distinguish the solution from existing methods or competing systems.

### The Alignment Principle
A CVP is only effective if there is a direct mapping between technical capabilities and stakeholder requirements. If a technical feature does not map to a "Pain Reliever" or a "Gain Creator," it is considered "Value-Neutral" and may represent wasted development effort.

### Perceived vs. Actual Value
*   **Actual Value:** The objective utility provided by the system (e.g., 20% faster processing).
*   **Perceived Value:** The stakeholder's subjective assessment of the utility, influenced by ease of use, reliability, and trust.

## Standard Model

The standard model for defining a Core Value Proposition follows the **Value Proposition Canvas** logic, adapted for technical systems:

1.  **Stakeholder Profile:**
    *   **Jobs:** What is the stakeholder trying to achieve?
    *   **Pains:** What prevents them from achieving it?
    *   **Gains:** What would a "perfect" outcome look like?
2.  **Value Map:**
    *   **Products/Services:** The specific components of the system.
    *   **Pain Relievers:** How the components eliminate specific pains.
    *   **Gain Creators:** How the components produce the desired gains.

The CVP is validated when the **Value Map** aligns perfectly with the **Stakeholder Profile**.

## Common Patterns

### The Efficiency Pattern
Focuses on reducing the time, effort, or resources required to complete a task. Common in automation and infrastructure tooling.

### The Risk Mitigation Pattern
Focuses on increasing security, compliance, or reliability. Common in cybersecurity and financial systems.

### The Innovation Pattern
Focuses on enabling entirely new capabilities that were previously impossible. Common in R&D and emerging technology sectors.

## Anti-Patterns

### The "Kitchen Sink"
Attempting to provide value to every possible stakeholder simultaneously, resulting in a diluted proposition that appeals to no one.

### Feature-Centricity
Defining value based on *what* the system does (features) rather than *why* it matters to the user (outcomes).

### The "Ghost" Value
Claiming value in areas where the stakeholder perceives no pain or desire for gain. This leads to high-quality engineering for problems that do not exist.

### Vague Superlatives
Using non-descriptive terms like "best-in-class," "seamless," or "next-generation" without providing quantifiable evidence or specific context.

## Edge Cases

### Internal-Only Systems
For systems used exclusively within an organization (e.g., internal APIs), the "customer" is another technical team. The CVP must focus on developer experience (DX) and operational overhead rather than traditional market value.

### Legacy System Maintenance
The value proposition for maintaining a legacy system often shifts from "Innovation" to "Stability" and "Cost Avoidance." The CVP must justify continued investment versus the risk of migration.

### Multi-Sided Platforms
Systems that serve multiple distinct stakeholder groups (e.g., a marketplace with buyers and sellers) require a separate, yet harmonious, CVP for each group.
