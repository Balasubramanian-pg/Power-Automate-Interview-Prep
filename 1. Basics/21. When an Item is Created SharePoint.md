# 21. When an Item is Created SharePoint

Canonical documentation for 21. When an Item is Created SharePoint. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
The "When an Item is Created" event serves as the primary entry point for event-driven architectures within the SharePoint ecosystem. Its purpose is to provide a reliable signal that a new discrete data entity (an "Item") has been successfully committed to a List or Library. This mechanism allows decoupled systems to initiate business logic, data transformation, or notification workflows immediately following the instantiation of data, without requiring the originating client to manage those downstream processes.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative, focusing on the logical event behavior rather than specific workflow engine configurations.

## Scope
Clarify what is in scope and out of scope for this topic.

**In scope:**
*   The lifecycle transition from non-existence to a committed state within a SharePoint container.
*   The metadata and schema requirements for event triggering.
*   The theoretical propagation of the "Create" signal to subscribers.
*   The distinction between manual, programmatic, and system-driven creation events.

**Out of scope:**
*   Specific vendor implementations (e.g., Power Automate, Logic Apps, Nintex) except where used as examples of the subscriber model.
*   UI-level "New Form" rendering logic.
*   Update or Delete event behaviors.

## Definitions
Provide precise definitions for key terms.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Item | A single row or entry within a SharePoint List, consisting of a collection of fields (columns). |
| Trigger | The specific condition or event listener that detects the completion of a "Create" operation. |
| List | The primary container for items, defining the schema and storage parameters. |
| Event Receiver | A server-side or remote mechanism that intercepts the creation event to execute code. |
| Commit | The point at which the item is successfully written to the underlying database and assigned a Unique Identifier (ID). |
| Payload | The set of data transmitted to the subscriber, typically containing the item's fields and system metadata. |

## Core Concepts
### Event Atomicity
The "When an Item is Created" event is conceptually atomic. It should only fire once the item has passed all server-side validation and has been assigned a permanent ID. If a transaction fails during the creation process, the event must not be broadcast.

### Polling vs. Webhooks
The detection of a created item generally follows one of two architectural patterns:
1.  **Webhook (Push):** SharePoint notifies an external endpoint immediately upon the commit.
2.  **Polling (Pull):** A subscriber periodically queries the list for items with a "Created" timestamp newer than the last check.

### Schema Consistency
The event payload is bound by the schema of the parent List. Any subscriber to this event must be prepared to handle the fields defined in the List's content type at the moment of creation.

## Standard Model
The standard model for the "When an Item is Created" event follows a linear progression:

1.  **Instantiation Request:** A user or system submits a request to create an item via REST API, CSOM, or the browser.
2.  **Validation:** The system validates data types, required fields, and permissions.
3.  **Persistence:** The item is written to the database; a unique integer ID and a GUID are generated.
4.  **Event Generation:** The system generates an internal signal representing the `ItemAdded` (asynchronous) or `ItemAdding` (synchronous) event.
5.  **Broadcast/Notification:** The signal is picked up by registered subscribers (Workflows, Webhooks, or Event Receivers).
6.  **Execution:** The downstream logic begins processing using the item's initial state.

## Common Patterns
*   **Data Enrichment:** Upon creation, a secondary process calculates values for empty fields based on the initial input.
*   **Notification Routing:** Sending alerts to specific stakeholders based on the metadata provided during creation.
*   **Integration Synchronization:** Mirroring the new item into an external system (e.g., an ERP or CRM) to maintain data parity.
*   **Permission Hardening:** Automatically breaking permission inheritance on the new item to apply granular security.

## Anti-Patterns
*   **The Infinite Loop:** A process triggered by "When an Item is Created" that creates a new item in the same list, triggering itself indefinitely.
*   **Heavy Synchronous Processing:** Attaching long-running logic to synchronous event receivers, which causes the user's browser to hang or time out during the "Save" operation.
*   **Polling Overload:** Setting a polling interval so frequent (e.g., every second) that it degrades the performance of the host environment.
*   **Ignoring Bulk Operations:** Designing logic that assumes items are created one by one, failing when 1,000 items are uploaded via a datasheet or migration tool.

## Edge Cases
*   **Folder Creation:** In many implementations, creating a folder in a list or library triggers the "Item Created" event. Logic must differentiate between "Item" and "Folder" content types.
*   **System Account Creation:** Items created by system processes or service accounts may need to be excluded from certain business workflows to avoid circularity.
*   **Drafts and Minor Versions:** In libraries with content approval, an item may be "Created" but not visible to all users until it reaches a certain publication state.
*   **Attachments:** The "Item Created" event may fire before attachments are fully uploaded and associated with the item, leading to "File Not Found" errors in downstream logic.

## Related Topics
*   **Item Update Events:** Logic triggered when existing data is modified.
*   **Change Tracking:** The broader concept of monitoring delta changes in a dataset.
*   **SharePoint REST API:** The interface often used to programmatically trigger or respond to creation events.
*   **Concurrency Management:** Handling multiple simultaneous creation events.
