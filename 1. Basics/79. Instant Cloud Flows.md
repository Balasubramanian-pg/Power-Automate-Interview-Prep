# 79. Instant Cloud Flows

Canonical documentation for 79. Instant Cloud Flows. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
Instant Cloud Flows exist to bridge the gap between human-initiated actions and automated digital processes. They address the need for "on-demand" automation where the execution of a workflow is not dictated by a pre-defined schedule or a data-change event, but rather by a specific user intent or an external manual signal. 

This topic addresses the problem space of ad-hoc task execution, providing a mechanism to trigger complex logic sequences instantly from a variety of interfaces (mobile devices, desktop applications, or integrated buttons) without requiring the user to understand the underlying backend complexity.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative.

## Scope
Clarify what is in scope and out of scope for this topic.

**In scope:**
* **Trigger Mechanisms:** The conceptual framework for manual and on-demand invocation.
* **Input Schemas:** The definition and handling of user-provided data at the point of initiation.
* **Execution Context:** How user identity and environment data are passed to the flow.
* **Synchronicity:** The behavior of flows regarding immediate feedback versus background processing.

**Out of scope:**
* **Specific Vendor Implementations:** Proprietary syntax or UI layouts of specific automation platforms.
* **Hardware Triggers:** Physical IoT buttons (unless treated as a digital signal).
* **Automated Triggers:** Scheduled or data-driven triggers (e.g., "When a record is created").

## Definitions
Provide precise definitions for key terms.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Instant Trigger** | A mechanism that initiates a workflow immediately upon a manual action or an API-based "on-demand" call. |
| **Input Parameter** | A data field defined at the trigger level that a user or calling system must provide to the flow. |
| **Execution Context** | The metadata surrounding a flow run, including the initiator's identity, timestamp, and originating location. |
| **Payload** | The structured data package sent from the trigger to the subsequent actions in the flow. |
| **Synchronous Execution** | A flow pattern where the initiator waits for the flow to complete before receiving a response. |
| **Asynchronous Execution** | A flow pattern where the initiator receives an acknowledgment of start, but the flow continues in the background. |

## Core Concepts

### 1. Manual Invocation
The defining characteristic of an Instant Cloud Flow is that the "start" signal is external and intentional. Unlike automated flows that "listen" for changes, instant flows "wait" for a command.

### 2. Parameterization
Instant flows often require inputs to function correctly. These inputs are defined by a schema (e.g., text, boolean, number, file) and are collected at the moment of invocation. This allows a single flow logic to be reused across different data contexts.

### 3. User Context and Permissions
Because these flows are triggered by individuals, the security model often relies on the "Run-only user" concept. The flow may execute using the permissions of the person who clicked the button, or it may execute using a centralized service account, depending on the architectural requirement.

### 4. Connectivity and Portability
Instant flows are designed to be accessible across multiple surfaces. A single instant flow should, in theory, be triggerable from a mobile app, a web browser, or an embedded component within another software application.

## Standard Model
The standard model for an Instant Cloud Flow follows a linear progression:

1.  **The Trigger Event:** A user or system sends a "Start" signal.
2.  **Input Collection:** The system validates that all required parameters (if any) are present and conform to the defined schema.
3.  **Authentication/Authorization:** The system verifies that the initiator has the right to execute the flow.
4.  **Logic Execution:** The workflow engine processes the defined actions (conditionals, loops, integrations).
5.  **Output/Acknowledgment:** The system provides feedback to the initiator (either a "Success" message or the final result of the logic).

## Common Patterns

### The "Button" Pattern
A simple, parameter-less trigger used to perform a repetitive task, such as "Send a 'Running Late' email to my next meeting attendees."

### The "Input-Process-Output" Pattern
The user provides specific data (e.g., a project ID and a status), the flow processes that data across multiple systems, and returns a confirmation or a generated document.

### The "Proxy" Pattern
An instant flow acts as a secure gateway, allowing a user to perform an action in a high-privilege system (like a database) without having direct access to that system, by using the flow's service connection.

### The "Integration Trigger"
Triggering a flow from within another application (e.g., selecting a row in a spreadsheet and clicking a custom "Process" button).

## Anti-Patterns

*   **Polling via Instant Flow:** Manually triggering a flow to check for updates that should be handled by an automated "On Change" trigger.
*   **Over-parameterization:** Requiring so many manual inputs that the "automation" becomes more labor-intensive than a manual process.
*   **Long-running Synchronous Flows:** Designing a flow that keeps the user waiting for several minutes for a response, leading to timeout errors or poor user experience.
*   **Lack of Validation:** Failing to validate input parameters at the trigger level, leading to flow failures deep within the logic.

## Edge Cases

*   **Interrupted Connectivity:** If a user triggers a flow from a mobile device and immediately loses internet access, the system must define whether the flow should proceed or fail based on whether the payload reached the cloud orchestrator.
*   **Recursive Triggers:** An instant flow that, as part of its logic, triggers itself or another instant flow, potentially creating an infinite loop or exhausting API limits.
*   **Bulk Invocation:** When a user attempts to trigger an instant flow on hundreds of items simultaneously (e.g., from a list view), the system must handle throttling and concurrency limits.
*   **Schema Evolution:** Changing the required input parameters of an existing instant flow while older versions of the trigger (e.g., an un-updated mobile app) are still in use.
