# 25. Manual Triggers Overview

Canonical documentation for 25. Manual Triggers Overview. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
The purpose of Manual Triggers is to provide a controlled interface for human intervention within automated systems. While automation aims to reduce manual effort, certain operational contexts require human judgment, specific timing, or ad-hoc execution that cannot be fully codified into deterministic logic. Manual triggers address the need for intentionality, allowing operators to initiate, resume, or override processes based on external factors or qualitative assessments.

## Scope
Clarify what is in scope and out of scope for this topic.

**In scope:**
* Core functionality of human-initiated execution entry points.
* Theoretical boundaries between automated and manual state transitions.
* Input validation and parameterization at the point of invocation.
* Security and auditability requirements for manual interventions.

**Out of scope:**
* Specific vendor implementations (e.g., GitHub Actions `workflow_dispatch`, Jenkins "Build with Parameters").
* User interface (UI) design patterns for buttons or forms.
* Hardware-level physical triggers (e.g., physical emergency stop buttons).

## Definitions
Provide precise definitions for key terms.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Manual Trigger | A mechanism that initiates a process or workflow only upon explicit human action. |
| Invocation | The act of activating a trigger, transitioning a process from an idle or paused state to an active state. |
| Input Schema | The predefined structure and constraints of data that a user must provide when activating a trigger. |
| Gate | A specific type of manual trigger that acts as a blocking point within an existing automated sequence, requiring approval to proceed. |
| Ad-hoc Execution | The non-scheduled, non-event-driven initiation of a workflow. |
| Principal | The authenticated entity (user or service account acting on behalf of a user) that activates the trigger. |

## Core Concepts

### Intentionality and Control
Manual triggers represent a shift from reactive automation (event-driven) to proactive intervention. They are used when the "why" and "when" of a process require human context that the system does not possess.

### Parameterization
Unlike automated triggers which often rely on payload data from an event (e.g., a webhook), manual triggers often require **Runtime Parameters**. These allow the principal to define the scope of the execution (e.g., selecting a target environment, a specific version, or a debug flag) at the moment of invocation.

### Authorization and Identity
Because manual triggers bypass automated logic, they represent a higher security risk. A core concept of manual triggers is the binding of the execution to a **Principal**. Every manual invocation must be attributable to an identity and governed by Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

### State Transition
A manual trigger typically facilitates one of two transitions:
1.  **Idle to Running:** Starting a new process from scratch.
2.  **Paused to Running:** Resuming a process that has reached a "Gate" or "Approval" step.

## Standard Model
The standard model for a manual trigger follows a linear lifecycle:

1.  **Definition:** The system defines the availability of the trigger, including the required permissions and the Input Schema.
2.  **Authentication/Authorization:** The system verifies the identity of the Principal and confirms they have the "Execute" or "Trigger" permission.
3.  **Input Collection:** The Principal provides data matching the Input Schema.
4.  **Validation:** The system validates the provided inputs against the schema before initiating the process.
5.  **Invocation:** The process is queued or executed.
6.  **Audit Logging:** The system records the event, including the Principal's identity, the timestamp, and the parameters provided.

## Common Patterns

### The "Promotion" Pattern
Used to move an artifact or state from one environment to another (e.g., Staging to Production). This pattern relies on a manual trigger to signify that human verification of the lower environment is complete.

### The "Emergency Break-Glass" Pattern
A manual trigger designed to execute high-privilege recovery actions, such as forcing a database failover or clearing a global cache, which should never happen automatically.

### The "Parameter-Driven Utility" Pattern
A general-purpose workflow (e.g., a data cleanup script) that remains idle until a user triggers it with specific parameters defining which data to process.

### The "Manual Approval Gate"
A workflow starts automatically but pauses at a critical juncture. The manual trigger in this pattern is the "Approve" or "Reject" action taken by a stakeholder.

## Anti-Patterns

### Shadow Triggers
Implementing manual triggers that do not log the identity of the Principal. This creates "ghost" executions where the system state changes without a clear audit trail of who initiated the change.

### Parameter Overload
Requiring an excessive number of manual inputs that could have been derived automatically. This increases the risk of human error and reduces the efficiency of the trigger.

### Bypassing Automated Safety
Using a manual trigger to execute a process that skips essential automated safety checks (e.g., unit tests or security scans) without a documented "Emergency" justification.

### The "Human Poller"
A scenario where a human is required to manually trigger a process that is actually deterministic and could have been automated via a schedule or event.

## Edge Cases

### Concurrent Invocations
What happens when two Principals activate the same manual trigger simultaneously? A robust system must define a concurrency policy (e.g., queueing, serializing, or rejecting the second request).

### Stale Parameters
A Principal opens a trigger interface, waits an hour, and then submits. If the underlying system state has changed, the parameters provided may no longer be valid or safe.

### Partial Authorization
A scenario where a Principal has permission to trigger a workflow but does not have permission to access the resources the workflow touches. The system must decide whether to fail at the trigger point or during execution.

### Orphaned Gates
In a "Manual Approval Gate" pattern, if the designated approver is unavailable or the workflow engine restarts, the trigger may become "orphaned," leaving the process in a permanent state of suspension.
