# 86. Attended vs Unattended Mode

Canonical documentation for 86. Attended vs Unattended Mode. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
The distinction between Attended and Unattended modes addresses the operational requirement to categorize how software processes, automations, or installations interact with human operators and system resources. This topic exists to define the boundaries of human intervention, security context, and execution environments, ensuring that systems are designed with the appropriate level of autonomy and oversight.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative.

## Scope
Clarify what is in scope and out of scope for this topic.

**In scope:**
*   Definitions of operational modes based on human presence.
*   Security and session context requirements for each mode.
*   Triggering mechanisms and execution environments.
*   Theoretical boundaries between manual intervention and full autonomy.

**Out of scope:**
*   Specific vendor implementations (e.g., specific RPA or DevOps tool syntax).
*   Hardware-specific execution details.
*   Programming language-specific library implementations.

## Definitions
Provide precise definitions for key terms.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Attended Mode** | A state of execution where a human operator is present, providing inputs, triggers, or oversight within a shared user session. |
| **Unattended Mode** | A state of execution that occurs independently of human presence, typically running in a background or service session. |
| **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** | A model where a process pauses to request human judgment or validation before continuing. |
| **Session Context** | The security and environmental shell (user profile, permissions, UI desktop) in which a process executes. |
| **Trigger** | The event (manual, scheduled, or data-driven) that initiates the transition from idle to executing. |
| **Headless Execution** | A subset of unattended mode where the process runs without a Graphical User Interface (GUI). |

## Core Concepts

### 1. Human Presence and Interaction
The primary differentiator is the requirement for a human to be physically or logically "present." 
*   **Attended:** The process acts as an assistant to the user, often sharing the same screen, mouse, and keyboard focus.
*   **Unattended:** The process acts as a digital worker or service, operating on dedicated resources without competing for peripheral control.

### 2. Security and Identity
*   **Attended:** Usually inherits the permissions and identity of the logged-in interactive user. Security is governed by the user's active session.
*   **Unattended:** Requires a dedicated service account or managed identity. It must handle authentication (e.g., certificates, vault-stored credentials) without manual password entry.

### 3. Execution Environment
*   **Attended:** Runs in the foreground of a workstation or virtual desktop.
*   **Unattended:** Runs in the background, often on servers, locked virtual machines, or containers where no interactive desktop is rendered to a physical monitor.

## Standard Model

The standard model for categorizing these modes follows the "Front-Office vs. Back-Office" paradigm:

### The Attended Model (Front-Office)
*   **Initiation:** Manually started by the user.
*   **Purpose:** Task augmentation, data entry assistance, or real-time validation.
*   **Constraint:** Limited by the user's working hours and the availability of their workstation.

### The Unattended Model (Back-Office)
*   **Initiation:** Triggered by schedules, API calls, or system events (e.g., a file appearing in a folder).
*   **Purpose:** High-volume processing, batch jobs, and 24/7 operational tasks.
*   **Constraint:** Requires robust error handling and logging, as there is no human to observe failures in real-time.

## Common Patterns

### 1. The Hybrid Pattern
A process begins in unattended mode (e.g., processing 1,000 invoices) but switches to an "attended" state or HITL pattern when an anomaly is detected that requires human judgment.

### 2. The Orchestrated Pattern
A central controller manages a fleet of unattended "bots" or agents, distributing work queues and monitoring health without human intervention.

### 3. The "Sidecar" Pattern
An attended process runs alongside a human's primary application, watching for specific UI events to provide "just-in-time" data or automation.

## Anti-Patterns

*   **The "Ghost" User:** Running unattended processes using an active human user's credentials on their primary workstation, leading to "resource contention" where the human and the process fight for mouse/keyboard control.
*   **Silent Failures in Unattended Mode:** Designing an unattended process that uses message boxes or UI pop-ups for errors. Since no human is there to click "OK," the process hangs indefinitely.
*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** Storing passwords in scripts to facilitate unattended login, rather than using secure secret management systems.
*   **Attended-Only Logic in Unattended Environments:** Relying on UI elements that only render when a physical monitor is attached or a session is active (e.g., certain hardware acceleration features).

## Edge Cases

*   **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):** Unattended processes often struggle with MFA. Canonical solutions involve using Service Principals, API Keys, or TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) automation, though the latter may bypass security policies.
*   **Screen Locking:** Some attended automations fail if the user locks their screen (Win+L), as the UI subsystem may stop rendering certain elements.
*   **Session 0 Isolation:** In Windows environments, unattended services run in Session 0, which has no UI. If a process expects a desktop, it will fail unless a virtual desktop session is specifically provisioned.
*   **Semi-Attended:** A mode where a user starts a process and then "hands off" the machine, but the process still requires the user's session to remain active and unlocked.
