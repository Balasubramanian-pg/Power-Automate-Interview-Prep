# 69. Dynamic Content Overview

Canonical documentation for 69. Dynamic Content Overview. This document defines concepts, terminology, and standard usage.

## Purpose
Dynamic content exists to solve the limitations of static communication by enabling the delivery of personalized, relevant, and context-aware information to users. In a digital ecosystem, "one-size-fits-all" content often fails to engage diverse audiences or meet specific user needs. Dynamic content addresses this by decoupling the content structure from the specific data values, allowing for real-time assembly of information based on defined logic, user attributes, or environmental triggers.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is intended to be implementation-agnostic and authoritative.

## Scope
Clarify what is in scope and out of scope for this topic.

**In scope:**
* The theoretical framework of data-driven content generation.
* Core components of dynamic systems (templates, logic, and data).
* General principles of personalization and contextualization.
* Structural requirements for dynamic rendering.

**Out of scope:**
* Specific programming language syntax (e.g., JavaScript, Python, AMPscript).
* Vendor-specific platform features (e.g., Salesforce, Adobe, HubSpot).
* Database administration or specific API protocols.

## Definitions
Provide precise definitions for key terms.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Dynamic Content** | Content that changes based on the behavior, preferences, and interests of the user or external data inputs. |
| **Placeholder/Token** | A variable or "merge tag" within a template that is replaced by actual data at the time of rendering. |
| **Conditional Logic** | The "if-then-else" rules that determine which content block is displayed to a specific user. |
| **Fallback Content** | Default content displayed when the required data for personalization is missing or invalid. |
| **Contextual Data** | Information regarding the user's current environment, such as location, device type, or time of day. |
| **Rendering** | The process of combining a template with data and logic to produce the final output. |

## Core Concepts

### The Content-Data Separation
The fundamental principle of dynamic content is the separation of the **presentation layer** (the template) from the **data layer** (the attributes). This allows a single template to serve an infinite number of variations without manual intervention.

### Rule-Based Selection
Dynamic content relies on a rules engine to evaluate criteria. These rules typically fall into three categories:
1.  **Attribute-based:** Using known data points (e.g., "If Industry = Finance").
2.  **Behavior-based:** Using past actions (e.g., "If User viewed Product X").
3.  **Context-based:** Using real-time environment data (e.g., "If Weather = Rain").

### Deterministic vs. Probabilistic Content
*   **Deterministic:** Content is served based on known, explicit data points (e.g., the user's first name).
*   **Probabilistic:** Content is served based on likelihood or predictive modeling (e.g., "Users like you also bought...").

## Standard Model
The standard model for dynamic content follows a linear processing flow:

1.  **Request:** A trigger (page load, email open, API call) initiates the content request.
2.  **Data Retrieval:** The system fetches relevant data for the specific user or context from a data store.
3.  **Logic Evaluation:** The rules engine processes the data against predefined conditions.
4.  **Assembly:** The system injects the selected content or data into the template placeholders.
5.  **Delivery:** The fully rendered, personalized content is served to the end-user.

## Common Patterns

### The "Default Value" Pattern
Every dynamic placeholder should have a defined default value. If a "First Name" token is empty, the system defaults to a generic term like "Customer" to ensure the sentence remains grammatically correct.

### The "Content Block" Pattern
Instead of changing individual words, entire sections of a layout (images, copy, and CTAs) are swapped out as a single unit based on a user's segment (e.g., "Loyalty Member" vs. "New Prospect").

### The "Lookup Table" Pattern
Using a reference table to map a simple data point to a complex output. For example, a "Store ID" in the user profile looks up the store's address, hours, and map image from a central repository.

## Anti-Patterns

### Over-Segmentation
Creating so many variations that the content becomes unmanageable or the sample size for each variation is too small to provide statistical significance for optimization.

### Hard-Coding Logic
Embedding business logic directly into the presentation layer rather than using a centralized rules engine. This makes updates difficult and increases the risk of inconsistency across channels.

### Ignoring the "Null" State
Failing to account for missing data. This results in broken layouts, such as "Hello {{FirstName}}," appearing as "Hello ," or broken image links.

### Excessive Latency
Implementing complex, multi-step data lookups that delay the rendering of the content, leading to a poor user experience or "flicker" (Content Layout Shift).

## Edge Cases

### Conflicting Rules
When a user meets the criteria for two different dynamic content variations simultaneously. A standard model must define **Priority Ranking** to determine which content takes precedence.

### Stale Data
When content is rendered based on data that has changed since the last cache update. This is particularly sensitive in inventory-based content (e.g., showing an "In Stock" banner for an item that just sold out).

### Localization and Character Length
Dynamic content in different languages can vary significantly in length. A design that works for "Sale" (English) may break when rendered as "Ausverkauf" (German) if the container is not fluid.
