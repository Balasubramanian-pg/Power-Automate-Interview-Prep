# 4. Data Transformation Patterns

Canonical documentation for 4. Data Transformation Patterns. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 4. Data Transformation Patterns exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Data Transformation Patterns exist to provide a standardized approach to converting data from one format to another, enabling seamless integration and exchange of data between different systems, applications, and stakeholders. The primary problem space addressed by Data Transformation Patterns includes data inconsistency, incompatibility, and inefficiency, which can lead to errors, delays, and increased costs in data-driven projects.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Data Transformation Patterns involve a series of steps that enable the conversion of data from a source format to a target format, while ensuring data quality, integrity, and consistency. This process typically includes data ingestion, data processing, data transformation, data validation, and data output, using various techniques, tools, and technologies.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Data Transformation | The process of converting data from one format to another, while preserving its meaning and context. |
| Data Mapping | The process of defining relationships between data elements in the source and target formats. |
| Data Validation | The process of checking data for errors, inconsistencies, and compliance with predefined rules and constraints. |
| Data Quality | The degree to which data is accurate, complete, consistent, and reliable. |
| ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) | A common data transformation pattern that involves extracting data from a source, transforming it into a target format, and loading it into a destination system. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Data Transformation Patterns include:
* Data format conversion: converting data from one format to another (e.g., CSV to JSON).
* Data type conversion: converting data from one data type to another (e.g., integer to string).
* Data aggregation: combining data from multiple sources into a single output.
* Data filtering: selecting a subset of data based on predefined criteria.
* Data sorting: arranging data in a specific order.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Data Transformation Patterns typically involves the following stages:
1. Data ingestion: collecting data from various sources.
2. Data processing: transforming, aggregating, filtering, and sorting data.
3. Data transformation: converting data from the source format to the target format.
4. Data validation: checking data for errors and inconsistencies.
5. Data output: loading transformed data into a destination system.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common Data Transformation Patterns include:
* ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
* ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)
* Data warehousing
* Data migration
* Data integration

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Data Transformation include:
* Hardcoding data transformations, making them inflexible and difficult to maintain.
* Using proprietary or custom formats, which can lead to vendor lock-in and limited interoperability.
* Ignoring data quality and validation, which can result in errors and inconsistencies.
* Using inefficient or outdated technologies, which can lead to performance issues and scalability problems.
* Failing to document data transformations, making it difficult to understand and maintain the process.
