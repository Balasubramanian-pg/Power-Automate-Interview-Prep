# 2. Orchestration vs Automation

Canonical documentation for 2. Orchestration vs Automation. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 2. Orchestration vs Automation exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Orchestration and automation are two related but distinct concepts that aim to streamline and optimize complex processes, particularly in the context of IT, cloud computing, and DevOps. The primary purpose of understanding the difference between orchestration and automation is to address the challenges of managing and coordinating multiple tasks, services, and systems in a efficient, scalable, and reliable manner. The problem space includes the need to reduce manual errors, increase productivity, and improve the overall quality of service delivery.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Orchestration and automation can be visualized as a hierarchy of process management, where automation focuses on the execution of individual tasks or workflows, and orchestration encompasses the coordination and management of multiple automated tasks, workflows, and services. This mental model highlights the importance of understanding the relationships between different components, systems, and processes, and how they can be integrated and managed to achieve specific business or operational goals.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Automation | The use of technology to perform tasks or processes without human intervention, typically using predefined rules, scripts, or workflows. |
| Orchestration | The process of coordinating, managing, and automating multiple tasks, workflows, or services to achieve a specific goal or outcome, often involving the integration of multiple systems, tools, or technologies. |
| Workflow | A series of tasks or processes that are executed in a specific order to achieve a particular objective or outcome. |
| Service | A self-contained unit of functionality that provides a specific capability or feature, often exposed through APIs or other interfaces. |
| Integration | The process of connecting and combining multiple systems, tools, or technologies to enable data exchange, coordination, or cooperation. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of orchestration and automation include:
* **Task automation**: The use of technology to perform individual tasks or processes without human intervention.
* **Workflow management**: The coordination and execution of multiple tasks or processes in a specific order to achieve a particular objective or outcome.
* **Service integration**: The connection and combination of multiple systems, tools, or technologies to enable data exchange, coordination, or cooperation.
* **Process optimization**: The ongoing evaluation and improvement of processes to increase efficiency, reduce errors, and improve overall quality.
* **Scalability and flexibility**: The ability to adapt and scale processes, systems, and technologies to meet changing business or operational requirements.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for orchestration and automation typically involves the following components and layers:
* **Automation layer**: Responsible for executing individual tasks or workflows using predefined rules, scripts, or tools.
* **Orchestration layer**: Coordinates and manages multiple automated tasks, workflows, or services to achieve specific goals or outcomes.
* **Integration layer**: Enables data exchange, coordination, or cooperation between multiple systems, tools, or technologies.
* **Monitoring and control layer**: Provides real-time visibility, monitoring, and control over automated processes and workflows.
* **Governance and security layer**: Ensures that automated processes and workflows comply with organizational policies, regulations, and security standards.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in orchestration and automation include:
* **Automating repetitive tasks**: Using automation to perform routine, repetitive tasks that do not require human intervention.
* **Workflow optimization**: Streamlining and optimizing workflows to reduce errors, increase efficiency, and improve overall quality.
* **Service-oriented architecture**: Designing systems and applications as a collection of services that can be integrated and orchestrated to achieve specific goals or outcomes.
* **DevOps and continuous integration**: Using automation and orchestration to support continuous integration, testing, and delivery of software applications and services.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in orchestration and automation include:
* **Over-automation**: Automating tasks or processes that are not well-suited for automation, or that require human judgment or intervention.
* **Under-orchestration**: Failing to coordinate and manage multiple automated tasks, workflows, or services, leading to inefficiencies, errors, or conflicts.
* **Lack of monitoring and control**: Failing to provide real-time visibility, monitoring, and control over automated processes and workflows, leading to errors, downtime, or security breaches.
* **Inadequate governance and security**: Failing to ensure that automated processes and workflows comply with organizational policies, regulations, and security standards, leading to risks, vulnerabilities, or non-compliance.
