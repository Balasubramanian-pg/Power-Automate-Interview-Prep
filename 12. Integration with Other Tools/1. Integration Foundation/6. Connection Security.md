# 6. Connection Security

Canonical documentation for 6. Connection Security. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 6. Connection Security exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Connection Security is a critical aspect of modern computing, as it addresses the need to protect data in transit between systems, applications, or services. The primary purpose of Connection Security is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data exchanged over a network. This is achieved by encrypting data, authenticating parties involved in the communication, and detecting any tampering or eavesdropping attempts. The problem space includes threats such as man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping, and data tampering, which can compromise the security and trustworthiness of the connection.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Connection Security involves a set of protocols, technologies, and best practices that work together to secure data in transit. This includes Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Internet Protocol Security (IPSec), and other encryption protocols. The conceptual model of Connection Security encompasses the following key components: encryption, authentication, access control, and key management. These components interact to establish a secure connection, protect data, and prevent unauthorized access.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Authentication | The process of verifying the identity of a party involved in a connection |
| Authorization | The process of granting access to a resource based on the authenticated identity |
| Encryption | The process of converting plaintext data into unreadable ciphertext to protect it from unauthorized access |
| Key Management | The process of generating, distributing, and managing cryptographic keys used for encryption and decryption |
| Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack | A type of attack where an attacker intercepts and alters communication between two parties |
| Secure Socket Layer (SSL) | A cryptographic protocol used to provide secure communication over the internet |
| Transport Layer Security (TLS) | A cryptographic protocol used to provide secure communication over the internet, successor to SSL |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Connection Security include: (1) encryption, which protects data from unauthorized access; (2) authentication, which verifies the identity of parties involved in the connection; (3) access control, which grants or denies access to resources based on authenticated identity; and (4) key management, which generates, distributes, and manages cryptographic keys. These concepts work together to establish a secure connection and protect data in transit.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Connection Security involves the use of TLS or SSL protocols to establish a secure connection. This model includes the following steps: (1) handshake, where the parties involved in the connection agree on the encryption protocol and keys; (2) encryption, where data is converted into unreadable ciphertext; (3) authentication, where the identity of the parties is verified; and (4) key exchange, where cryptographic keys are generated and distributed.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Connection Security include: (1) using TLS or SSL protocols for secure web browsing; (2) implementing VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) for secure remote access; (3) using encryption protocols such as IPSec for secure network communication; and (4) implementing secure key management practices, such as key rotation and revocation.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Connection Security include: (1) using weak or outdated encryption protocols; (2) neglecting to implement proper key management practices; (3) using unsecured communication protocols, such as HTTP; and (4) ignoring security warnings or alerts, such as certificate expiration or revocation.
