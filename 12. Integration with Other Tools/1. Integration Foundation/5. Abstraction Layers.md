# 5. Abstraction Layers

Canonical documentation for 5. Abstraction Layers. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 5. Abstraction Layers exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Abstraction layers are a fundamental concept in software development, allowing for the separation of complex systems into manageable, modular components. The primary purpose of abstraction layers is to provide a structured approach to system design, enabling developers to focus on specific aspects of the system without being overwhelmed by its overall complexity. The class of problems addressed by abstraction layers includes system integration, scalability, maintainability, and reusability.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Abstraction layers can be visualized as a stack of layers, each representing a specific level of abstraction. Each layer communicates with its adjacent layers through well-defined interfaces, hiding the implementation details of the underlying layers. This layered approach enables developers to work on individual components without affecting the entire system, promoting a modular and flexible design.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Abstraction | The process of exposing only the necessary information about an object or system while hiding its internal details. |
| Layer | A discrete level of abstraction, representing a specific component or subsystem. |
| Interface | A defined boundary between two layers, specifying the interactions and data exchange between them. |
| Encapsulation | The concept of bundling data and its associated methods into a single unit, hiding the internal implementation details. |
| Modularity | The ability of a system to be composed of independent, interchangeable modules, each with its own distinct functionality. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of abstraction layers include:
* **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer focuses on a specific aspect of the system, reducing complexity and improving maintainability.
* **Interface-Based Design**: Well-defined interfaces between layers enable loose coupling and facilitate system evolution.
* **Information Hiding**: Each layer exposes only the necessary information, reducing dependencies and promoting modularity.
* **Layered Architecture**: The stacking of layers enables a hierarchical organization of the system, simplifying navigation and understanding.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for abstraction layers typically consists of the following layers:
* **Presentation Layer**: Handles user interaction and provides a user interface.
* **Application Layer**: Encapsulates the business logic and provides services to the presentation layer.
* **Business Logic Layer**: Implements the core business rules and processes.
* **Data Access Layer**: Manages data storage and retrieval.
* **Infrastructure Layer**: Provides the underlying platform and infrastructure services.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in abstraction layers include:
* **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data access and provides a standardized interface for data retrieval.
* **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Structures the system as a collection of services, each providing a specific functionality.
* **Model-View-Controller**: Separates the application logic into three interconnected components.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in abstraction layers include:
* **God Object**: A single, monolithic layer that encompasses multiple responsibilities, leading to tight coupling and reduced maintainability.
* **Shotgun Surgery**: A change that requires modifications to multiple, unrelated layers, indicating a lack of encapsulation and modularity.
* **Spaghetti Code**: A complex, intertwined system with no clear layering or separation of concerns.
