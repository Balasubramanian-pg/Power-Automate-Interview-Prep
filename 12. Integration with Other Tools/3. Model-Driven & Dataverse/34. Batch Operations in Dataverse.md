# 34. Batch Operations in Dataverse

Canonical documentation for 34. Batch Operations in Dataverse. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 34. Batch Operations in Dataverse exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Batch operations in Dataverse are designed to efficiently manage and process large datasets, reducing the overhead of individual transactions and improving overall system performance. The primary problem space addressed by batch operations includes scenarios where multiple records need to be created, updated, or deleted in a single operation, such as data migration, integration with external systems, or bulk data processing.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Batch operations in Dataverse can be conceptualized as a mechanism to group multiple operations into a single, all-or-nothing transaction. This approach ensures data consistency and reduces the risk of partial updates or errors. The conceptual model involves defining a batch, specifying the operations to be performed, and executing the batch as a single unit of work.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Batch | A collection of operations that are executed as a single, all-or-nothing transaction. |
| Operation | A single action, such as create, update, or delete, that is performed on a record. |
| Transaction | A sequence of operations that are executed as a single, logical unit of work. |
| Dataverse | A cloud-based data platform that provides a centralized repository for storing and managing data. |
| Record | A single entity or row in a dataset, represented by a unique identifier and a set of attributes. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of batch operations in Dataverse include:
* **Atomicity**: Ensuring that either all or none of the operations in a batch are executed, maintaining data consistency.
* **Consistency**: Verifying that the batch operations comply with the defined rules and constraints, such as data validation and referential integrity.
* **Isolation**: Executing batch operations independently, without interfering with other concurrent transactions.
* **Durability**: Ensuring that the effects of a batch operation are persisted and remain intact even in the event of a failure.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for batch operations in Dataverse involves the following steps:
1. **Define the batch**: Specify the operations to be included in the batch, such as creating, updating, or deleting records.
2. **Validate the batch**: Verify that the batch operations comply with the defined rules and constraints.
3. **Execute the batch**: Perform the batch operations as a single, all-or-nothing transaction.
4. **Monitor and report**: Track the progress and outcome of the batch operation, providing feedback and error handling as needed.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for batch operations in Dataverse include:
* **Bulk data import**: Creating multiple records in a single batch operation, often used for data migration or integration with external systems.
* **Data synchronization**: Updating multiple records in a single batch operation, often used to maintain data consistency across different systems or datasets.
* **Periodic processing**: Executing batch operations on a scheduled basis, such as daily or weekly, to perform tasks like data aggregation or reporting.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for batch operations in Dataverse include:
* **Overly large batches**: Executing batches that are too large, leading to performance issues, timeouts, or errors.
* **Inconsistent batch definitions**: Failing to define batches consistently, resulting in errors or inconsistencies in the data.
* **Lack of error handling**: Neglecting to implement proper error handling and feedback mechanisms, making it difficult to diagnose and resolve issues.
