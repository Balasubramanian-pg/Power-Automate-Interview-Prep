# 29. Triggering from Command Bar

Canonical documentation for 29. Triggering from Command Bar. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 29. Triggering from Command Bar exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Command Bar is a central component in many applications, providing users with a quick and efficient way to execute commands, search for information, and navigate through the system. However, the traditional command bar has limitations, such as requiring users to manually type commands or search queries. Triggering from the Command Bar addresses these limitations by enabling users to initiate actions, access information, and interact with the system in a more intuitive and streamlined manner. The primary problem space that Triggering from Command Bar addresses includes improving user experience, reducing user effort, and increasing productivity.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Triggering from Command Bar involves integrating the command bar with various system components, such as menus, buttons, and other interactive elements. This integration enables users to trigger actions, access information, and navigate through the system using a combination of keyboard shortcuts, voice commands, or other input methods. The conceptual model of Triggering from Command Bar consists of three primary components: the command bar, the trigger mechanism, and the action or response. The command bar serves as the primary interface for user input, while the trigger mechanism interprets the user's input and initiates the corresponding action or response.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Command Bar | A text-based input field that allows users to execute commands, search for information, or navigate through the system. |
| Trigger | A mechanism that initiates an action or response based on user input, such as a keyboard shortcut, voice command, or mouse click. |
| Action | A specific response or behavior that occurs as a result of a trigger, such as opening a menu, executing a command, or displaying information. |
| Response | The outcome or result of an action, such as a notification, a dialog box, or a change in the system state. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Triggering from Command Bar include:
* **Input interpretation**: The process of analyzing user input to determine the intended action or response.
* **Trigger mapping**: The association of specific triggers with corresponding actions or responses.
* **Action execution**: The process of performing the intended action or response based on the trigger.
* **Feedback mechanisms**: The provision of visual, auditory, or haptic feedback to inform the user of the outcome or result of the action.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Triggering from Command Bar involves a modular architecture that consists of the following components:
* **Command Bar Module**: Responsible for handling user input and providing feedback.
* **Trigger Module**: Interprets user input and initiates the corresponding action or response.
* **Action Module**: Performs the intended action or response.
* **Feedback Module**: Provides visual, auditory, or haptic feedback to the user.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Triggering from Command Bar include:
* **Keyboard shortcut triggers**: Using keyboard shortcuts to initiate actions or responses.
* **Voice command triggers**: Using voice commands to initiate actions or responses.
* **Mouse click triggers**: Using mouse clicks to initiate actions or responses.
* **Predictive triggers**: Using predictive algorithms to anticipate and initiate actions or responses based on user behavior.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Triggering from Command Bar include:
* **Overly complex triggers**: Using triggers that are difficult to remember or use.
* **Inconsistent trigger mapping**: Failing to provide consistent trigger mappings across the system.
* **Insufficient feedback**: Failing to provide adequate feedback to the user regarding the outcome or result of the action.
* **Trigger overload**: Providing too many triggers, leading to user confusion and decreased productivity.
