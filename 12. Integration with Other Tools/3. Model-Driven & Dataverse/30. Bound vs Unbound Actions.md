Canonical documentation for 30. Bound vs Unbound Actions. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 30. Bound vs Unbound Actions exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of understanding bound vs unbound actions is to clarify the distinction between actions that are tied to specific objects or contexts and those that are not. This distinction is crucial in various domains, including programming, philosophy, and cognitive science, as it helps address problems related to action representation, intentionality, and context dependence. The class of problems it addresses includes issues of action identification, context sensitivity, and the relationship between actions and their targets or objects.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
At a high level, the concept of bound vs unbound actions can be understood through the lens of intentionality and context. Bound actions are those that are intentionally directed towards a specific object, goal, or context, implying a clear relationship between the action and its target. Unbound actions, in contrast, lack this specific direction or context, existing independently of any particular object or goal. This dichotomy helps in understanding how actions are perceived, represented, and executed across different domains.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Bound Action | An action that is intentionally directed towards a specific object, goal, or context. |
| Unbound Action | An action that lacks a specific direction or context, existing independently of any particular object or goal. |
| Intentionality | The property of being directed towards an object or goal, crucial for understanding bound actions. |
| Context Dependence | The degree to which the meaning or execution of an action depends on the situation or environment in which it occurs. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts underlying bound vs unbound actions include intentionality, context dependence, and the action-object relationship. Intentionality is key to distinguishing bound actions, as it implies a deliberate direction towards an object or goal. Context dependence highlights how the meaning or execution of actions can vary based on the situation. The action-object relationship is fundamental in understanding how actions are tied to or independent of specific objects or contexts.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for understanding bound vs unbound actions involves categorizing actions based on their intentionality and context dependence. Bound actions are characterized by high intentionality and context dependence, whereas unbound actions exhibit low intentionality and context dependence. This model provides a framework for analyzing and predicting the behavior of actions within different contexts and domains.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns include the use of bound actions in goal-oriented tasks, where the action is clearly directed towards achieving a specific objective. Unbound actions are often observed in exploratory or creative behaviors, where the action is not predefined by a specific goal but rather emerges from the interaction with the environment. Another pattern is the conversion of unbound actions into bound ones through the process of contextualization or objectification.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in the context of bound vs unbound actions include the inappropriate application of bound actions in situations requiring flexibility or creativity, leading to rigid and ineffective behaviors. Another anti-pattern is the failure to recognize and leverage the potential of unbound actions in innovative or open-ended tasks, thereby constraining the scope of possible outcomes.
