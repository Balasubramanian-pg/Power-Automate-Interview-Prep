Canonical documentation for 28. Custom Pages and Flow. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 28. Custom Pages and Flow exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Custom Pages and Flow is to provide a flexible and extensible framework for creating tailored user experiences. It addresses the class of problems related to rigid and inflexible workflow systems, where users are forced to adapt to a predefined sequence of steps. By allowing for custom pages and flow, users can create workflows that are tailored to their specific needs, improving productivity and efficiency.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Custom Pages and Flow can be thought of as a modular and dynamic system, where individual components (pages) can be combined in various ways to create a customized workflow. This system allows for the creation of unique user experiences, where each page can be designed to perform a specific function or set of functions, and the flow between pages can be tailored to meet the needs of the user.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Custom Page | A tailored page designed to perform a specific function or set of functions within a workflow. |
| Flow | The sequence of steps or pages that a user navigates through to complete a task or process. |
| Workflow | A series of tasks or activities that are performed in a specific order to achieve a particular goal or objective. |
| Modular | A design approach that allows individual components to be combined in various ways to create a customized system. |
| Dynamic | A system that can change or adapt in response to user input or other factors. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Custom Pages and Flow include modularity, flexibility, and extensibility. Modularity allows individual components to be combined in various ways, while flexibility enables the system to adapt to changing user needs. Extensibility provides the ability to add new components or functionality as required, allowing the system to evolve over time.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Custom Pages and Flow involves a modular architecture, where individual pages are designed to perform specific functions, and the flow between pages is controlled by a workflow engine. This engine manages the sequence of pages and ensures that the user is presented with the correct page at the right time.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Custom Pages and Flow include the use of wizards, where a complex task is broken down into a series of simpler steps, and the use of dashboards, where key information and metrics are presented in a single, customizable page.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Custom Pages and Flow include the use of rigid and inflexible workflows, where the user is forced to follow a predefined sequence of steps, and the use of cluttered and confusing pages, where too much information is presented at once.
