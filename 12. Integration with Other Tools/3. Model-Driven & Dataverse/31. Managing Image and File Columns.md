# 31. Managing Image and File Columns

Canonical documentation for 31. Managing Image and File Columns. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 31. Managing Image and File Columns exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of managing image and file columns is to provide a structured approach to storing, retrieving, and manipulating files and images within a database or data storage system. This addresses the problem of efficiently handling large amounts of unstructured data, such as images and files, while maintaining data integrity and consistency. The class of problems it addresses includes data storage, data retrieval, data manipulation, and data consistency.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of managing image and file columns involves understanding the relationship between files, images, and the database or data storage system. It includes concepts such as file storage, image compression, data encryption, and access control. The high-level mental model consists of three primary components: data storage, data processing, and data retrieval. Data storage involves storing files and images in a structured and organized manner. Data processing involves manipulating and transforming files and images. Data retrieval involves accessing and retrieving files and images.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Blob | A binary large object, used to store files and images in a database |
| File Column | A column in a database table used to store files |
| Image Column | A column in a database table used to store images |
| Data Compression | The process of reducing the size of files and images to improve storage efficiency |
| Data Encryption | The process of protecting files and images from unauthorized access |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of managing image and file columns include data storage, data processing, and data retrieval. Data storage involves storing files and images in a structured and organized manner. Data processing involves manipulating and transforming files and images. Data retrieval involves accessing and retrieving files and images. Additional core concepts include data compression, data encryption, and access control.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for managing image and file columns involves using a combination of database tables and file systems to store and retrieve files and images. The model consists of three primary components: a database table to store file metadata, a file system to store files, and a database column to store images. The database table stores information about the files, such as file name, file size, and file type. The file system stores the actual files. The database column stores images.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for managing image and file columns include using a separate table to store file metadata, using a file system to store files, and using a database column to store images. Another common pattern is to use data compression and data encryption to improve storage efficiency and protect files and images from unauthorized access.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for managing image and file columns include storing files and images in a single database column, using a single database table to store all file metadata and files, and failing to use data compression and data encryption. Another anti-pattern is to use a database column to store large files, which can lead to performance issues and data corruption.
