Canonical documentation for 35. When an Action is Performed Trigger. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 35. When an Action is Performed Trigger exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The "When an Action is Performed Trigger" is a fundamental concept in workflow automation, business process management, and event-driven systems. It exists to address the need for automatic initiation of subsequent actions or processes in response to the completion or occurrence of a specific action or event. This trigger type is crucial in scenarios where efficient, real-time responses to actions are necessary, such as in customer relationship management (CRM) systems, manufacturing processes, or financial transaction processing. The primary problem it solves is the automation of workflows, ensuring that processes are initiated promptly without manual intervention, thus enhancing efficiency, reducing latency, and improving overall system responsiveness.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
At its core, the "When an Action is Performed Trigger" is an event listener that monitors specific actions or events within a system. Once the defined action occurs, the trigger activates, initiating a predefined set of subsequent actions or workflows. This concept relies on a clear understanding of the system's events, the conditions under which the trigger should be activated, and the actions that should be performed in response. It's a key component in designing dynamic, responsive systems that can adapt and react to changing conditions or user interactions in real-time.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Trigger | A mechanism that initiates an action or set of actions in response to a specific event or condition. |
| Action | A discrete task or operation performed within a system. |
| Event | An occurrence or happening within a system that can be detected and responded to. |
| Workflow | A series of actions or tasks that are automated and managed to achieve a specific business process or goal. |
| Automation | The use of technology to perform tasks automatically, reducing the need for manual intervention. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the "When an Action is Performed Trigger" include:
- **Event Detection**: The ability of the system to identify and recognize specific actions or events.
- **Condition Evaluation**: The process of assessing whether the detected event meets the predefined conditions for triggering the subsequent actions.
- **Action Initiation**: The mechanism by which the trigger starts the subsequent workflow or actions in response to the event.
- **Workflow Automation**: The integration of the trigger with broader business processes to automate tasks and enhance efficiency.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for implementing the "When an Action is Performed Trigger" involves:
1. **Event Definition**: Clearly defining the action or event that will trigger the response.
2. **Condition Setup**: Configuring the conditions under which the trigger will activate.
3. **Action Specification**: Defining the subsequent actions or workflows to be initiated.
4. **Trigger Activation**: Implementing the trigger mechanism to detect the event and evaluate conditions.
5. **Monitoring and Adjustment**: Continuously monitoring the trigger's performance and adjusting conditions or actions as necessary.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns include:
- **Sequential Workflow**: Initiating a series of actions in a specific order following the trigger event.
- **Parallel Workflow**: Starting multiple actions simultaneously in response to the trigger.
- **Conditional Workflow**: Initiating different workflows based on the evaluation of conditions after the trigger event.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns to avoid include:
- **Overly Complex Conditions**: Setting conditions that are too complex or difficult to maintain, leading to errors or inefficiencies.
- **Insufficient Testing**: Failing to thoroughly test the trigger and subsequent actions, potentially leading to unforeseen consequences.
- **Lack of Monitoring**: Not regularly monitoring the performance and impact of the trigger, missing opportunities for optimization.
