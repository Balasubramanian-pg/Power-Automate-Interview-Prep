# 33. Dataverse Change Tracking

Canonical documentation for 33. Dataverse Change Tracking. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 33. Dataverse Change Tracking exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Dataverse Change Tracking exists to provide a mechanism for monitoring and tracking changes to data within a Dataverse repository. The primary problem it addresses is the need for data managers, researchers, and other stakeholders to be aware of changes to data over time, ensuring data integrity, reproducibility, and compliance with regulatory requirements. This is particularly important in research environments where data is frequently updated, and changes can have significant implications for research outcomes.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Dataverse Change Tracking operates on the principle of recording all changes made to datasets, including additions, deletions, and modifications. This creates a change history that allows users to view, compare, and potentially revert changes made to the data. The system is designed to be transparent, providing a clear audit trail of all transactions, and to support collaboration by enabling multiple users to work on the same dataset while minimizing conflicts.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Change Tracking | The process of monitoring and recording all changes made to a dataset. |
| Dataverse | A repository for storing, sharing, and preserving data. |
| Dataset | A collection of data, which can include files, metadata, and other associated information. |
| Versioning | The management of changes to datasets through the creation of distinct versions. |
| Audit Trail | A record of all changes made to a dataset, including who made the change, when, and what was changed. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Dataverse Change Tracking include:
- **Immutability**: Once data is written, it cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring the integrity of the dataset.
- **Version Control**: Managing different versions of a dataset to track changes over time.
- **Auditability**: Maintaining a complete and accurate record of all changes for transparency and compliance.
- **Collaboration**: Supporting multiple users in making changes to a dataset while preventing conflicts.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Dataverse Change Tracking involves:
1. **Initialization**: Setting up a Dataverse repository with change tracking enabled.
2. **Data Ingestion**: Adding datasets to the repository.
3. **Change Detection**: Automatically detecting changes made to the datasets.
4. **Versioning**: Creating new versions of datasets upon changes.
5. **Audit Logging**: Recording all changes in an audit trail.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Dataverse Change Tracking include:
- **Regular Snapshots**: Periodically creating snapshots of datasets to track changes over time.
- **Collaborative Editing**: Multiple users editing a dataset with change tracking to manage versions and prevent conflicts.
- **Compliance Reporting**: Using change tracking data to generate reports for regulatory compliance.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns to avoid in Dataverse Change Tracking include:
- **Manual Change Tracking**: Relying on manual methods to track changes, which can be error-prone and inefficient.
- **Ignoring Audit Trails**: Failing to regularly review audit trails, which can lead to undetected errors or malicious activities.
- **Disabling Versioning**: Not using version control, making it difficult to manage changes and collaborate effectively.
