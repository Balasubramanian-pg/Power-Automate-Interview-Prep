Canonical documentation for 27. Business Process Flows Integration. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 27. Business Process Flows Integration exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of Business Process Flows Integration is to streamline and automate business processes by integrating various systems, applications, and data sources. This integration enables organizations to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance decision-making capabilities. The class of problems it addresses includes process inefficiencies, data silos, and manual errors, which can lead to decreased productivity, poor customer satisfaction, and increased risk.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Business Process Flows Integration involves the coordination of multiple systems, applications, and data sources to execute a series of processes, tasks, and activities. This integration enables the flow of data, information, and work products across different departments, teams, and organizations, resulting in improved collaboration, reduced cycle times, and increased transparency.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Business Process | A series of coordinated activities, tasks, and processes designed to achieve a specific business objective or outcome. |
| Integration | The process of connecting and coordinating multiple systems, applications, and data sources to enable the flow of data, information, and work products. |
| Workflow | A specific sequence of tasks, activities, and processes that are executed in a particular order to achieve a business objective or outcome. |
| BPMN | Business Process Model and Notation, a graphical representation of business processes used to design, execute, and improve business processes. |
| API | Application Programming Interface, a set of defined rules and protocols that enables different systems, applications, and data sources to communicate and exchange data. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Business Process Flows Integration include:
* Process modeling: defining and designing business processes using graphical representations such as BPMN.
* Workflow automation: automating the execution of business processes using workflow management systems and APIs.
* Data integration: integrating data from multiple sources to enable the flow of information and work products.
* System integration: integrating multiple systems, applications, and data sources to enable the coordination of business processes.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Business Process Flows Integration involves the following components:
* Process design: designing business processes using graphical representations such as BPMN.
* Workflow automation: automating the execution of business processes using workflow management systems and APIs.
* Data integration: integrating data from multiple sources using APIs, messaging queues, or data virtualization.
* System integration: integrating multiple systems, applications, and data sources using APIs, messaging queues, or service-oriented architecture.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Business Process Flows Integration include:
* Request-response pattern: a pattern where a request is sent to a system or application, and a response is received.
* Publish-subscribe pattern: a pattern where a message is published to a topic, and multiple subscribers receive the message.
* Workflow pattern: a pattern where a series of tasks and activities are executed in a specific order to achieve a business objective or outcome.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Business Process Flows Integration include:
* Point-to-point integration: integrating systems, applications, and data sources using point-to-point connections, which can lead to complexity, rigidity, and maintenance issues.
* Hardcoding: hardcoding business rules, processes, and data into systems, applications, and code, which can lead to inflexibility and maintenance issues.
* Lack of standardization: not using standard protocols, APIs, and data formats, which can lead to integration challenges and maintenance issues.
