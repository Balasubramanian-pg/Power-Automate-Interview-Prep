> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 26. Automated vs Instant Dataverse Flows exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Automated vs Instant Dataverse Flows is to provide a clear understanding of the differences between automated and instant flows in Dataverse, a platform that enables the creation of data-driven applications. The problem space addressed by this topic includes the challenges of choosing the right type of flow for a specific use case, understanding the implications of each type of flow on data processing and integration, and optimizing flow performance.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Automated and instant flows in Dataverse are two types of workflows that enable data integration, processing, and automation. Automated flows are triggered by specific events or schedules, whereas instant flows are triggered manually or through API calls. Understanding the differences between these two types of flows is crucial for designing and implementing efficient data-driven applications.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Automated Flow | A type of flow that is triggered by a specific event or schedule, such as a data update or a timed interval. |
| Instant Flow | A type of flow that is triggered manually or through an API call, allowing for real-time data processing and integration. |
| Dataverse | A platform that enables the creation of data-driven applications, providing a range of tools and services for data integration, processing, and automation. |
| Trigger | An event or action that initiates the execution of a flow, such as a data update or a user interaction. |
| Action | A specific task or operation performed within a flow, such as data transformation or API call. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Automated vs Instant Dataverse Flows include:
* **Triggering mechanisms**: Understanding how automated and instant flows are triggered, including event-based triggers, scheduled triggers, and manual triggers.
* **Flow execution**: Understanding how flows are executed, including the sequence of actions, data processing, and integration.
* **Data processing**: Understanding how data is processed and transformed within flows, including data mapping, data validation, and data formatting.
* **Integration**: Understanding how flows integrate with external systems and services, including API calls, data imports, and data exports.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Automated vs Instant Dataverse Flows involves:
* **Automated flows** for scheduled or event-based data processing and integration, such as data synchronization or report generation.
* **Instant flows** for real-time data processing and integration, such as data validation or API calls.
* **Hybrid approach** that combines automated and instant flows to achieve optimal performance and efficiency.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Automated vs Instant Dataverse Flows include:
* **Data synchronization**: Using automated flows to synchronize data between systems or services.
* **Real-time data processing**: Using instant flows to process data in real-time, such as data validation or API calls.
* **Report generation**: Using automated flows to generate reports on a scheduled basis.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Automated vs Instant Dataverse Flows include:
* **Overusing instant flows**: Using instant flows for scheduled or event-based data processing, leading to performance issues and inefficiencies.
* **Underusing automated flows**: Failing to use automated flows for scheduled or event-based data processing, leading to manual errors and inefficiencies.
* **Ignoring data validation**: Failing to validate data within flows, leading to data inconsistencies and errors.
