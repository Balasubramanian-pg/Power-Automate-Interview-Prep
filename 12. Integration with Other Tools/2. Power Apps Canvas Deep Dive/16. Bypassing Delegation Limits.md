Canonical documentation for 16. Bypassing Delegation Limits. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 16. Bypassing Delegation Limits exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Bypassing Delegation Limits is a critical concept in distributed systems, particularly in the context of authentication, authorization, and access control. It exists to address the limitations and constraints imposed by delegation protocols, which can hinder the flexibility and scalability of systems. The primary problem space revolves around the need to extend or bypass the restrictions of delegation protocols to facilitate more complex and dynamic interactions between entities, while maintaining security and integrity.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
At its core, bypassing delegation limits involves techniques and strategies to circumvent the inherent constraints of delegation protocols. This can include mechanisms to extend trust chains, elevate privileges, or enable indirect access to resources, all while ensuring that security policies and access controls are not compromised. The conceptual model encompasses a deep understanding of delegation protocols, their limitations, and the creative solutions that can be applied to overcome these limitations without undermining the security posture of the system.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Delegation | The act of granting authority or permission to another entity to perform actions on behalf of the original entity. |
| Delegation Protocol | A set of rules and standards that govern how delegation is performed, including the establishment, management, and revocation of delegated authorities. |
| Delegation Limits | The constraints or restrictions imposed by a delegation protocol on the scope, duration, or extent of delegated authority. |
| Bypassing | Techniques or mechanisms used to circumvent or extend these delegation limits without violating the underlying security principles. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of bypassing delegation limits include understanding the delegation protocols, identifying the specific limits that need to be bypassed, and applying appropriate techniques to extend or circumvent these limits. This involves a deep dive into the mechanics of delegation, the implications of bypassing limits, and the security considerations that must be addressed to prevent vulnerabilities or unauthorized access.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for bypassing delegation limits typically involves a multi-step approach: (1) assessing the current delegation protocol and its limits, (2) identifying the requirements for bypassing these limits, (3) selecting appropriate techniques or mechanisms for bypassing, and (4) implementing these solutions while ensuring compliance with security policies and access controls. This model emphasizes the importance of a thorough risk assessment and the implementation of compensating controls to mitigate any potential security risks.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in bypassing delegation limits include the use of intermediate trust entities, the implementation of role-based access control (RBAC) systems, and the application of attribute-based access control (ABAC) models. These patterns provide structured approaches to managing and extending delegation, ensuring that access to resources is both flexible and secure.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in this context include the indiscriminate elevation of privileges, the blanket bypassing of security controls, and the failure to monitor and audit delegated access. These practices can significantly increase the risk of security breaches and undermine the integrity of the system, highlighting the importance of disciplined and controlled approaches to bypassing delegation limits.
