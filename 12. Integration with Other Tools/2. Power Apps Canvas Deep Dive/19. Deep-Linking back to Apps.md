# 19. Deep-Linking back to Apps

Canonical documentation for 19. Deep-Linking back to Apps. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 19. Deep-Linking back to Apps exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Deep-linking back to apps is a technique used to redirect users from a web page or another app to a specific page or feature within a native mobile app. This exists to address the problem of seamlessly transitioning users between different platforms, such as web and mobile, while maintaining context and providing a cohesive user experience. The class of problems it addresses includes improving user engagement, reducing friction, and enhancing the overall app experience.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Deep-linking back to apps involves creating a link that, when clicked, opens a specific page or feature within a native mobile app, rather than the app's homepage. This link can be shared via email, social media, or other channels, and can be used to promote specific content, offers, or features within the app. The mental model for deep-linking involves understanding the app's architecture, the user's journey, and the technical requirements for creating and handling deep links.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Deep Link | A URL that links to a specific page or feature within a native mobile app. |
| URI Scheme | A unique identifier for an app that allows it to handle deep links. |
| App Link | A link that opens a specific page or feature within a native mobile app. |
| Deferred Deep Link | A link that opens a specific page or feature within a native mobile app, even if the app is not installed on the user's device. |
| Attribution | The process of tracking and measuring the effectiveness of deep links in driving user engagement and conversions. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of deep-linking back to apps include:
* **Unique Identifiers**: Each app has a unique identifier, such as a URI scheme, that allows it to handle deep links.
* **Link Handling**: The app must be able to handle deep links, which involves parsing the link and navigating to the corresponding page or feature.
* **Context Maintenance**: Deep links must maintain context, such as user authentication and session state, to provide a seamless user experience.
* **Platform Support**: Deep-linking requires support from the underlying platform, including the operating system and browser.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for deep-linking back to apps involves:
1. **Creating a Deep Link**: The app creates a deep link that points to a specific page or feature within the app.
2. **Sharing the Link**: The link is shared via email, social media, or other channels.
3. **Handling the Link**: The user clicks the link, which opens the app and navigates to the corresponding page or feature.
4. **Maintaining Context**: The app maintains context, such as user authentication and session state, to provide a seamless user experience.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for deep-linking back to apps include:
* **Onboarding**: Using deep links to onboard new users and guide them through the app's features and functionality.
* **Promotions**: Using deep links to promote specific content, offers, or features within the app.
* **Social Sharing**: Using deep links to enable social sharing and drive user engagement.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for deep-linking back to apps include:
* **Broken Links**: Creating deep links that are broken or do not work as expected.
* **Lack of Context**: Failing to maintain context, such as user authentication and session state, when handling deep links.
* **Insufficient Testing**: Failing to test deep links thoroughly, which can lead to a poor user experience.
