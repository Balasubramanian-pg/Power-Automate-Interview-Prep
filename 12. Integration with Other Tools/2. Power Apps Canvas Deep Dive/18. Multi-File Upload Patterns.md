# 18. Multi-File Upload Patterns

Canonical documentation for 18. Multi-File Upload Patterns. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 18. Multi-File Upload Patterns exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of multi-file upload patterns is to provide a standardized approach to handling the upload of multiple files in a single transaction, addressing issues such as file validation, error handling, and user experience. This pattern exists to solve the problem of efficiently and reliably uploading multiple files, which is a common requirement in various applications, including content management systems, file sharing platforms, and e-commerce websites.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of multi-file upload patterns involves a user interface that allows users to select multiple files for upload, a backend system that handles file validation, processing, and storage, and a feedback mechanism that informs the user of the upload status. This pattern typically involves a combination of client-side and server-side technologies, including HTML, JavaScript, and server-side programming languages.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Chunking | The process of dividing a large file into smaller, more manageable pieces for upload. |
| File Validation | The process of checking uploaded files for validity, including file type, size, and content. |
| Upload Token | A unique identifier assigned to an upload session, used to track progress and manage concurrency. |
| Concurrent Uploads | The ability to upload multiple files simultaneously, improving overall upload performance. |
| Upload Callback | A function or event handler that is triggered upon completion of an upload, used to notify the user or perform additional processing. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of multi-file upload patterns include:
* **File selection**: allowing users to select multiple files for upload
* **File validation**: checking uploaded files for validity and conformity to requirements
* **Upload management**: handling the upload process, including chunking, concurrency, and error handling
* **Feedback mechanisms**: providing users with updates on upload progress and status
* **Security**: ensuring the upload process is secure, including protection against malware and unauthorized access

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for multi-file upload patterns involves a combination of client-side and server-side technologies, including:
* **Client-side**: using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create a user interface for file selection and upload
* **Server-side**: using server-side programming languages, such as Java, Python, or Node.js, to handle file validation, processing, and storage
* **API-based**: using RESTful APIs or other API architectures to manage the upload process and provide feedback to the user

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for multi-file upload include:
* **Drag-and-drop uploads**: allowing users to drag and drop files into the upload interface
* **Bulk uploads**: allowing users to upload multiple files at once, using a single interface
* **Upload queues**: managing uploads in a queue, allowing users to upload multiple files concurrently
* **Progress indicators**: providing users with visual feedback on upload progress, using progress bars or other indicators

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for multi-file upload include:
* **Lack of validation**: failing to validate uploaded files, leading to security vulnerabilities and data corruption
* **Inadequate feedback**: failing to provide users with timely and accurate feedback on upload progress and status
* **Insufficient error handling**: failing to handle errors and exceptions properly, leading to upload failures and user frustration
* **Insecure upload protocols**: using insecure upload protocols, such as FTP or HTTP, instead of secure protocols like HTTPS or SFTP
