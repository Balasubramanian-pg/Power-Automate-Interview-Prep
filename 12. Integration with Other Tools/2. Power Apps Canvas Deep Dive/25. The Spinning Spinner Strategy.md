Canonical documentation for 25. The Spinning Spinner Strategy. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 25. The Spinning Spinner Strategy exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Spinning Spinner Strategy exists to address the problem of efficiently handling asynchronous operations in a user interface, particularly when dealing with multiple concurrent tasks. This strategy aims to provide a seamless user experience by managing the visual representation of ongoing processes, thereby reducing user frustration and improving overall system responsiveness.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Spinning Spinner Strategy revolves around the concept of using visual indicators, such as spinners or progress bars, to inform users about the status of ongoing operations. This approach enables developers to decouple the user interface from the underlying processing, allowing for a more responsive and engaging user experience.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Spinner | A visual indicator used to represent an ongoing operation or process. |
| Asynchronous Operation | A task that runs independently of the main program flow, often requiring a separate thread or process. |
| User Interface (UI) | The visual elements and interactions that a user engages with when interacting with a system or application. |
| Responsiveness | The ability of a system or application to respond promptly to user input and provide timely feedback. |
| Concurrent Task | A task that runs simultaneously with other tasks, often competing for system resources. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the Spinning Spinner Strategy include:
* Using visual indicators to represent ongoing operations
* Decoupling the user interface from underlying processing
* Managing concurrent tasks to ensure a responsive user experience
* Providing timely feedback to users about the status of ongoing operations

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the Spinning Spinner Strategy involves:
1. Initializing a visual indicator (e.g., spinner) when an asynchronous operation begins
2. Updating the visual indicator to reflect the progress or status of the operation
3. Hiding or removing the visual indicator when the operation completes
4. Ensuring that the user interface remains responsive throughout the operation

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for the Spinning Spinner Strategy include:
* Using a global spinner to represent overall system activity
* Employing task-specific spinners to provide detailed progress information
* Implementing a queueing system to manage concurrent tasks and prevent overload

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for the Spinning Spinner Strategy include:
* Using a single, static spinner that does not provide meaningful feedback
* Failing to update the visual indicator in a timely manner
* Overloading the user interface with too many concurrent spinners or indicators
