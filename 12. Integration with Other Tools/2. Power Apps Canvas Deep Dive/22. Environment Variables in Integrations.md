# 22. Environment Variables in Integrations

Canonical documentation for 22. Environment Variables in Integrations. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 22. Environment Variables in Integrations exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Environment variables in integrations exist to provide a flexible and dynamic way to configure and manage integrations between different systems, applications, or services. The primary problem space addressed by environment variables in integrations is the need to decouple configuration settings from the integration code itself, allowing for easier maintenance, scalability, and portability across different environments.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Environment variables in integrations can be thought of as a layer of abstraction between the integration code and the underlying infrastructure. This layer allows developers to define and manage configuration settings, such as API keys, endpoints, and credentials, in a centralized and modular way. By using environment variables, integrations can be designed to be more adaptable, reusable, and resilient to changes in the underlying systems or infrastructure.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Environment Variable | A named value that is stored outside of the integration code and can be referenced within the code to configure its behavior. |
| Integration | A connection or interface between two or more systems, applications, or services that enables the exchange of data or functionality. |
| Configuration Setting | A parameter or value that controls the behavior of an integration, such as an API key, endpoint, or credential. |
| Deployment Environment | A specific context in which an integration is deployed, such as development, testing, staging, or production. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of environment variables in integrations include:
* **Decoupling**: Separating configuration settings from the integration code to improve maintainability and scalability.
* **Modularity**: Organizing environment variables into modular, reusable components to simplify management and reuse.
* **Abstraction**: Using environment variables to abstract away underlying infrastructure details and focus on the integration logic.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for environment variables in integrations involves:
1. Defining environment variables in a centralized configuration file or repository.
2. Using a naming convention to organize and categorize environment variables.
3. Implementing a mechanism to inject environment variables into the integration code.
4. Using environment variables to configure integration behavior, such as API keys, endpoints, or credentials.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for environment variables in integrations include:
* **Using a single, centralized configuration file** to manage all environment variables.
* **Implementing a hierarchical naming convention** to organize environment variables by category or scope.
* **Using environment variable placeholders** in integration code to inject values from the configuration file.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for environment variables in integrations include:
* **Hardcoding configuration settings** directly into the integration code.
* **Using multiple, scattered configuration files** to manage environment variables.
* **Failing to implement proper security measures** to protect sensitive environment variables, such as API keys or credentials.
