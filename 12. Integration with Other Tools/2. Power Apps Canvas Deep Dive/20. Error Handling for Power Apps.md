# 20. Error Handling for Power Apps

Canonical documentation for 20. Error Handling for Power Apps. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 20. Error Handling for Power Apps exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Error handling in Power Apps is crucial for ensuring a seamless user experience and preventing data corruption. It addresses the class of problems related to unexpected errors, exceptions, and inconsistencies that may occur during app execution, such as data validation errors, network connectivity issues, and formula errors. Effective error handling helps developers to identify, diagnose, and resolve issues promptly, thereby minimizing downtime and improving overall app reliability.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Error handling in Power Apps involves a combination of proactive and reactive strategies. Proactive strategies focus on preventing errors from occurring in the first place, such as input validation, data type checking, and formula optimization. Reactive strategies, on the other hand, involve detecting and responding to errors when they do occur, using techniques such as error messaging, logging, and exception handling. The goal of error handling is to provide a robust and resilient app that can recover from errors and continue to function as expected.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Error | An unexpected event or condition that occurs during app execution, such as a data validation error or a network connectivity issue. |
| Exception | A specific type of error that is explicitly handled by the app, such as a divide-by-zero error or a null reference exception. |
| Error Handling | The process of detecting, diagnosing, and resolving errors that occur during app execution. |
| Error Message | A notification or alert that is displayed to the user when an error occurs, providing information about the error and any necessary corrective actions. |
| Logging | The process of recording error information, such as error messages and stack traces, for later analysis and debugging. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of error handling in Power Apps include:
* **Error detection**: Identifying when an error has occurred, using techniques such as try-catch blocks and error messaging.
* **Error diagnosis**: Determining the cause of the error, using techniques such as logging and debugging.
* **Error resolution**: Taking corrective action to resolve the error, such as displaying an error message or retrying a failed operation.
* **Error prevention**: Preventing errors from occurring in the first place, using techniques such as input validation and data type checking.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for error handling in Power Apps involves a combination of the following components:
* **Try-catch blocks**: Used to detect and handle exceptions, such as divide-by-zero errors or null reference exceptions.
* **Error messaging**: Used to display notifications or alerts to the user when an error occurs, providing information about the error and any necessary corrective actions.
* **Logging**: Used to record error information, such as error messages and stack traces, for later analysis and debugging.
* **Error handling formulas**: Used to define custom error handling logic, such as retrying a failed operation or displaying a custom error message.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for error handling in Power Apps include:
* **Input validation**: Validating user input to prevent errors, such as checking for null or empty values.
* **Data type checking**: Checking the data type of a value to prevent errors, such as checking if a value is a number or a string.
* **Formula optimization**: Optimizing formulas to prevent errors, such as using the `IfError` function to handle errors in a formula.
* **Error handling screens**: Creating custom screens to display error messages and provide corrective actions.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for error handling in Power Apps include:
* **Ignoring errors**: Failing to detect or handle errors, which can lead to data corruption or app crashes.
* **Displaying technical error messages**: Displaying technical error messages to the user, which can be confusing or intimidating.
* **Not logging errors**: Failing to log error information, which can make it difficult to diagnose and resolve issues.
* **Not testing error handling**: Failing to test error handling logic, which can lead to errors or inconsistencies in the app.
