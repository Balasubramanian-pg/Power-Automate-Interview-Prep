# 15. The Long-Running Process UX

Canonical documentation for 15. The Long-Running Process UX. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 15. The Long-Running Process UX exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Long-Running Process UX exists to provide a seamless user experience for processes that take an extended period to complete, such as data imports, report generation, or complex computations. The class of problems it addresses includes user frustration, anxiety, and uncertainty when dealing with prolonged wait times, as well as the need for clear communication, progress updates, and feedback mechanisms.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The Long-Running Process UX involves a combination of design principles, patterns, and techniques that work together to create a positive user experience during extended processing times. This includes providing clear expectations, progress indicators, and feedback mechanisms to keep users informed and engaged throughout the process.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Asynchronous Processing | A processing mode where tasks are executed in the background, allowing users to continue interacting with the system. |
| Progress Indicator | A visual or textual cue that informs users about the progress of a long-running process. |
| Feedback Mechanism | A design element that provides users with updates, notifications, or alerts about the status of a long-running process. |
| Idle Time | The period during which a system or process is waiting for user input or is not performing any tasks. |
| Timeout | A predetermined period after which a process is automatically terminated or cancelled if it has not completed. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of The Long-Running Process UX include:
* Managing user expectations through clear communication and progress indicators
* Providing feedback mechanisms to keep users informed and engaged
* Minimizing idle time and optimizing system performance
* Handling errors and exceptions gracefully
* Ensuring accessibility and usability for all users

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for The Long-Running Process UX involves the following components:
1. Initial Notification: Inform users that a long-running process has started
2. Progress Updates: Provide regular progress indicators and feedback mechanisms
3. Intermediate Notifications: Alert users to any changes or issues during the process
4. Completion Notification: Inform users when the process is complete
5. Final Feedback: Provide a summary of the process outcome and any relevant results

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for The Long-Running Process UX include:
* Using progress bars or spinners to indicate progress
* Displaying estimated completion times or remaining time
* Providing cancel or pause options for user control
* Offering real-time updates or notifications
* Using animation or micro-interactions to enhance the user experience

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for The Long-Running Process UX include:
* Failing to provide clear expectations or progress indicators
* Not handling errors or exceptions properly
* Using ambiguous or unclear language in notifications or feedback
* Not providing cancel or pause options for user control
* Using intrusive or annoying notifications that disrupt the user experience
