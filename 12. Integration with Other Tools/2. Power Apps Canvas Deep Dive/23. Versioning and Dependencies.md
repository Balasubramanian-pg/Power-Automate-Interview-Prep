# 23. Versioning and Dependencies

Canonical documentation for 23. Versioning and Dependencies. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 23. Versioning and Dependencies exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Versioning and dependencies exist to manage the complexity of software development by providing a systematic approach to tracking changes and relationships between different components. The primary problem space addressed by versioning and dependencies includes ensuring consistency, reproducibility, and maintainability of software systems over time. This involves managing different versions of software components, libraries, and frameworks, as well as dependencies between them, to prevent issues such as version conflicts, compatibility problems, and regression errors.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of versioning and dependencies involves understanding the lifecycle of software components, from development to deployment. It encompasses the concepts of version control, which manages changes to source code over time, and dependency management, which handles the relationships between different components. This includes understanding how versions are assigned, updated, and tracked, as well as how dependencies are declared, resolved, and managed across different environments and projects.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Version | A specific iteration of a software component, library, or framework, identified by a unique version number or identifier. |
| Dependency | A relationship between two or more software components, where one component relies on the other to function correctly. |
| Version Control System (VCS) | A tool or system used to manage changes to source code over time, such as Git or SVN. |
| Package Manager | A tool or system used to manage dependencies and install software components, such as npm or pip. |
| Semantic Versioning | A versioning scheme that follows a specific format (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) to convey compatibility information. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of versioning and dependencies include:
- **Version Identification**: Assigning unique identifiers to different versions of software components.
- **Dependency Declaration**: Specifying the dependencies required by a software component.
- **Version Resolution**: Determining the specific version of a dependency to use in a given context.
- **Dependency Management**: Handling the acquisition, updating, and removal of dependencies.
- **Compatibility**: Ensuring that different versions of software components work correctly together.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for versioning and dependencies involves using a combination of version control systems (VCS) and package managers. The VCS manages changes to source code, while the package manager handles dependencies. This model typically includes:
- Using semantic versioning for version identification.
- Declaring dependencies in a project's configuration files (e.g., `package.json` for npm).
- Utilizing a package manager to resolve and manage dependencies.
- Implementing continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate testing, building, and deployment.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in versioning and dependencies include:
- **Fixed Dependencies**: Specifying exact versions of dependencies to ensure reproducibility.
- **Range Dependencies**: Declaring a range of acceptable versions for a dependency to allow for updates.
- **Dependency Pinning**: Locking dependencies to specific versions to prevent unexpected changes.
- **Version Locking**: Freezing the versions of dependencies for a project to maintain consistency.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in versioning and dependencies include:
- **Version Numbering Without Semantic Meaning**: Using version numbers that do not follow a logical or semantic scheme.
- **Overly Broad Dependency Ranges**: Specifying dependency ranges that are too wide, leading to potential compatibility issues.
- **Ignoring Dependency Updates**: Failing to regularly update dependencies, which can lead to security vulnerabilities and compatibility problems.
- **Manual Dependency Management**: Managing dependencies manually instead of using automated tools, which can be error-prone and time-consuming.
