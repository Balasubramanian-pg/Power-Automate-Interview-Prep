# 24. Calling Custom APIs

Canonical documentation for 24. Calling Custom APIs. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 24. Calling Custom APIs exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Calling Custom APIs exists to provide a standardized approach for integrating custom-built APIs into larger applications, addressing the need for flexible, scalable, and maintainable interactions between disparate systems. The class of problems it addresses includes enabling communication between custom services, facilitating data exchange, and ensuring seamless integration of third-party APIs.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of Calling Custom APIs revolves around the idea of creating a unified interface for interacting with custom-built APIs, allowing developers to focus on building business logic rather than worrying about the intricacies of API integration. This model encompasses the concepts of API design, security, authentication, and data serialization.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| API | Application Programming Interface, a set of defined rules that enable different applications to communicate with each other |
| Custom API | A tailored API designed to meet the specific needs of an application or organization |
| API Endpoint | A specific URL that an API uses to interact with a resource or service |
| API Key | A unique identifier used for authentication and authorization when accessing an API |
| JSON | JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data interchange format commonly used for API data exchange |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Calling Custom APIs include understanding API design principles, such as RESTful architecture and API endpoint naming conventions, as well as security considerations, like authentication and authorization mechanisms. Additionally, knowledge of data serialization formats, such as JSON and XML, is essential for effective API interaction.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Calling Custom APIs involves a request-response cycle, where the client initiates an HTTP request to the API endpoint, including any necessary authentication credentials and data payload. The API processes the request, performs the desired action, and returns a response to the client, which can then be parsed and utilized as needed.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Calling Custom APIs include using API gateways for management and security, implementing caching mechanisms for improved performance, and utilizing API documentation tools, such as Swagger or OpenAPI, for clear and concise API definitions.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Calling Custom APIs include using insecure authentication mechanisms, such as plain text passwords, neglecting to implement proper error handling and logging, and failing to validate and sanitize user input data, which can lead to security vulnerabilities and API instability.
