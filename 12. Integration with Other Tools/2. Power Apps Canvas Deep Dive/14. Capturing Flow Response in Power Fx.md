Canonical documentation for 14. Capturing Flow Response in Power Fx. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 14. Capturing Flow Response in Power Fx exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Capturing Flow Response in Power Fx is designed to handle the complexities of managing and processing responses from various data sources and services within Power Fx. The primary problem it addresses is the need for a standardized and efficient way to capture, process, and utilize the responses from flows, which are critical for automating business processes, integrating systems, and enhancing overall productivity.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
At its core, capturing flow response in Power Fx involves creating a structured approach to receiving, parsing, and acting upon the outputs from flows. This encompasses understanding the types of responses that can be expected, the methods for capturing these responses, and the subsequent actions that can be triggered based on the response content. It integrates concepts from data processing, workflow automation, and application integration, providing a comprehensive framework for managing flow responses.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Flow | A series of automated processes or workflows that can interact with various data sources and services. |
| Response | The output or result generated by a flow, which can include data, status codes, or error messages. |
| Power Fx | A low-code programming language used for creating custom logic and automations within the Power Platform. |
| Capture | The process of retrieving and storing the response from a flow for further processing or analysis. |
| Trigger | An action or event that initiates a flow or a subsequent process based on the captured response. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of capturing flow response in Power Fx include:
- **Response Handling**: Mechanisms for receiving and interpreting responses from flows.
- **Data Processing**: Techniques for parsing, transforming, and storing response data.
- **Conditional Logic**: The use of if-then statements and switch functions to make decisions based on response content.
- **Error Handling**: Strategies for managing and mitigating errors that occur during the capture or processing of flow responses.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for capturing flow response in Power Fx typically involves the following steps:
1. **Flow Initiation**: Starting a flow either manually or through an automated trigger.
2. **Response Capture**: Using Power Fx formulas to capture the response from the flow.
3. **Response Processing**: Applying data processing and conditional logic to the captured response.
4. **Action Triggering**: Initiating subsequent actions or workflows based on the processed response.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns include:
- **Data Validation**: Verifying the integrity and format of the response data before processing.
- **Error Logging**: Recording errors for auditing and debugging purposes.
- **Response Caching**: Temporarily storing responses to improve performance or for later reference.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns to avoid include:
- **Unnecessary Complexity**: Overcomplicating the response capture and processing logic.
- **Inadequate Error Handling**: Failing to properly manage and respond to errors.
- **Data Exposure**: Insecurely storing or transmitting sensitive response data.
