Canonical documentation for 38. Deep-Linking to Teams Chats. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 38. Deep-Linking to Teams Chats exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Deep-linking to Teams chats enables seamless navigation between different applications and Microsoft Teams, streamlining communication and collaboration. It addresses the problem of fragmented workflows, where users need to switch between multiple apps and platforms to access relevant information and engage in discussions. By providing a direct link to a specific Teams chat, deep-linking facilitates efficient information sharing, reduces context switching, and enhances overall productivity.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Deep-linking to Teams chats involves generating a unique URL that points to a specific chat conversation, channel, or meeting in Microsoft Teams. This URL can be shared across various platforms, such as email, web applications, or mobile apps, allowing users to access the targeted Teams chat directly. The deep-linking process typically involves encoding the chat's identifier, such as the chat ID or thread ID, into the URL, which is then used to navigate to the corresponding chat in Teams.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Deep Link | A URL that points to a specific resource or location within an application, in this case, a Microsoft Teams chat. |
| Chat ID | A unique identifier assigned to a chat conversation in Microsoft Teams. |
| Thread ID | A unique identifier assigned to a specific thread within a chat conversation in Microsoft Teams. |
| Teams URL Scheme | A standardized format for constructing URLs that point to Microsoft Teams resources, including chats, channels, and meetings. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of deep-linking to Teams chats include:
* **Unique Identifiers**: Chat IDs and thread IDs serve as unique identifiers for chat conversations and threads, respectively, enabling precise targeting of specific chats.
* **URL Encoding**: The process of encoding the chat ID or thread ID into a URL, which is then used to navigate to the corresponding chat in Teams.
* **Teams URL Scheme**: A standardized format for constructing URLs that point to Microsoft Teams resources, ensuring consistency and interoperability across different platforms and applications.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for deep-linking to Teams chats involves the following steps:
1. Obtain the chat ID or thread ID of the target chat conversation.
2. Construct a URL using the Teams URL scheme, encoding the chat ID or thread ID into the URL.
3. Share the URL across various platforms, such as email, web applications, or mobile apps.
4. When a user clicks on the URL, they are redirected to the corresponding chat conversation in Microsoft Teams.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for deep-linking to Teams chats include:
* **Chat-based customer support**: Deep-linking to a support chat conversation to provide customers with direct access to assistance.
* **Meeting invitations**: Deep-linking to a meeting chat conversation to facilitate discussion and collaboration before, during, and after the meeting.
* **Content sharing**: Deep-linking to a chat conversation to share relevant content, such as files, images, or videos, with team members.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for deep-linking to Teams chats include:
* **Hardcoding chat IDs**: Hardcoding chat IDs into URLs, which can lead to broken links if the chat ID changes.
* **Using outdated URL schemes**: Using outdated or deprecated URL schemes, which can result in compatibility issues or broken links.
* **Not validating user permissions**: Failing to validate user permissions before deep-linking to a chat conversation, which can lead to unauthorized access or data breaches.
