Canonical documentation for 53. Interactive Adaptive Cards to Channels. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 53. Interactive Adaptive Cards to Channels exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The primary purpose of Interactive Adaptive Cards to Channels is to provide a flexible and dynamic way to present information and interact with users within various channels, such as messaging platforms, collaboration tools, or other digital interfaces. This technology addresses the problem of static and non-engaging user experiences, enabling developers to create immersive and responsive interactions that adapt to user input and context.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Interactive Adaptive Cards to Channels can be thought of as a modular and extensible framework for building interactive user interfaces that can be easily integrated into different channels. This framework consists of a set of components, including cards, actions, and inputs, which can be combined to create a wide range of interactive experiences. The adaptive nature of these cards allows them to adjust their content, layout, and behavior in response to user interactions, device capabilities, and other contextual factors.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Adaptive Card | A modular, interactive component that can be used to present information and interact with users within a channel. |
| Channel | A digital interface or platform through which users interact with adaptive cards, such as a messaging app or collaboration tool. |
| Card Action | A specific interaction or event that occurs when a user interacts with an adaptive card, such as clicking a button or submitting a form. |
| Input | A field or control that allows users to provide data or input to an adaptive card, such as a text box or dropdown menu. |
| Payload | The data or content associated with an adaptive card, which can be used to populate the card's fields or trigger specific actions. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Interactive Adaptive Cards to Channels include:
* Modularity: Adaptive cards are designed to be self-contained and modular, allowing them to be easily combined and reused within different channels and contexts.
* Interactivity: Adaptive cards are interactive, allowing users to engage with them through various actions and inputs.
* Adaptability: Adaptive cards can adjust their content, layout, and behavior in response to user interactions, device capabilities, and other contextual factors.
* Extensibility: The framework for building adaptive cards is designed to be extensible, allowing developers to create custom components and integrations.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Interactive Adaptive Cards to Channels involves the following components and interactions:
* Adaptive cards are created and configured using a set of predefined components and actions.
* Cards are rendered within a channel, such as a messaging platform or collaboration tool.
* Users interact with the cards through various actions and inputs, such as clicking buttons or submitting forms.
* The card's payload is updated in response to user interactions, and the card's content and behavior are adjusted accordingly.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Interactive Adaptive Cards to Channels include:
* Using adaptive cards to present simple, interactive interfaces for tasks such as surveys, quizzes, or feedback forms.
* Integrating adaptive cards with external services or APIs to provide dynamic content or functionality.
* Using adaptive cards to create immersive, interactive experiences, such as games or interactive stories.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Interactive Adaptive Cards to Channels include:
* Overusing adaptive cards, resulting in cluttered or overwhelming user interfaces.
* Failing to provide clear or consistent feedback to users, resulting in confusion or frustration.
* Ignoring accessibility or usability guidelines, resulting in adaptive cards that are difficult or impossible for some users to interact with.
