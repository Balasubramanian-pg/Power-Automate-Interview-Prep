> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 44. Managing Teams Membership exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Managing Teams Membership is crucial for organizations to efficiently collaborate, communicate, and manage access to resources. The primary purpose of managing teams membership is to ensure that the right people have the right level of access to the right resources at the right time. This involves creating, modifying, and terminating team memberships, as well as managing the associated permissions, roles, and responsibilities. The class of problems addressed by managing teams membership includes ensuring data security, preventing unauthorized access, and streamlining collaboration among team members.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of managing teams membership involves understanding the relationships between teams, members, roles, and permissions. Teams are groups of individuals with shared goals, responsibilities, and access to resources. Members are individuals who belong to one or more teams, and each member has a specific role within the team. Roles define the level of access, responsibilities, and permissions associated with each member. Permissions determine what actions members can perform within the team, such as creating, editing, or deleting resources.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Team | A group of individuals with shared goals, responsibilities, and access to resources. |
| Member | An individual who belongs to one or more teams. |
| Role | A set of permissions, responsibilities, and access levels associated with a member within a team. |
| Permission | A specific right or ability to perform an action within a team, such as creating, editing, or deleting resources. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of managing teams membership include:
* Team creation and management: creating, modifying, and terminating teams.
* Member management: adding, removing, and modifying members within teams.
* Role-based access control: assigning roles to members and defining the associated permissions.
* Permission management: granting, revoking, and modifying permissions for members within teams.
* Membership lifecycle management: managing the entire lifecycle of team memberships, from creation to termination.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for managing teams membership involves the following components:
* Team structure: a hierarchical or flat structure for organizing teams.
* Role definitions: a set of predefined roles with associated permissions and responsibilities.
* Membership management: a process for adding, removing, and modifying members within teams.
* Permission management: a process for granting, revoking, and modifying permissions for members within teams.
* Auditing and reporting: a mechanism for tracking and reporting on team membership and permission changes.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in managing teams membership include:
* Using role-based access control to simplify permission management.
* Implementing a hierarchical team structure to reflect organizational hierarchies.
* Using automation to streamline membership management, such as automatically adding or removing members based on job function or department.
* Regularly reviewing and updating team memberships and permissions to ensure they remain current and accurate.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in managing teams membership include:
* Using overly broad or generic roles that do not accurately reflect the responsibilities and permissions of team members.
* Failing to regularly review and update team memberships and permissions, leading to stale or inaccurate data.
* Not implementing adequate auditing and reporting mechanisms, making it difficult to track changes to team memberships and permissions.
* Using manual processes for membership management, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors.
