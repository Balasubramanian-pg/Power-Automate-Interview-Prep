> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 54. Teams Voice Transcription exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Teams Voice Transcription is a feature designed to transcribe voice conversations in real-time, enabling users to review and reference discussions after they have taken place. This feature addresses the problem of information loss and miscommunication that can occur during verbal conversations, particularly in remote or distributed teams. By providing a written record of discussions, Teams Voice Transcription helps to improve collaboration, increase productivity, and enhance overall communication effectiveness.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of Teams Voice Transcription involves the use of automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology to convert spoken language into text. This process occurs in real-time, allowing users to see the transcription as the conversation unfolds. The transcription is then stored and made available for later reference, enabling users to review and search the conversation history.
