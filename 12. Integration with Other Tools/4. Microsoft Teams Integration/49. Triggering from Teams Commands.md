Canonical documentation for 49. Triggering from Teams Commands. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 49. Triggering from Teams Commands exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Triggering from Teams Commands is to enable seamless integration of Microsoft Teams with external applications and services, allowing users to trigger specific actions or workflows directly from within the Teams platform. This addresses the problem of fragmented workflows, where users have to navigate between multiple applications to complete a task, reducing productivity and increasing the likelihood of errors.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Triggering from Teams Commands involves the use of custom-built commands, bots, or messaging extensions that can be invoked by users within the Teams interface. These commands can be used to perform a wide range of actions, such as creating new tasks, sending notifications, or retrieving information from external systems. The conceptual model involves a request-response cycle, where the user initiates a command, and the system processes the request, returning a response or triggering an action.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Command | A custom-built instruction that can be invoked by a user within the Teams interface |
| Bot | A software application that uses artificial intelligence to simulate conversation and interact with users |
| Messaging Extension | A custom-built application that extends the functionality of the Teams messaging platform |
| Trigger | An event or action that initiates a workflow or process |
| Workflow | A series of automated or manual tasks that are executed in a specific order to achieve a particular goal |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Triggering from Teams Commands include:
* Commands: Custom-built instructions that can be invoked by users
* Triggers: Events or actions that initiate workflows or processes
* Workflows: Series of automated or manual tasks that are executed in a specific order
* Integration: Seamless connection between Teams and external applications or services
* Security: Authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms to ensure secure interactions

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Triggering from Teams Commands involves the following components:
* User: Initiates a command or trigger within the Teams interface
* Command or Trigger: Processes the user's request and initiates a workflow or action
* Workflow or Action: Executes a series of automated or manual tasks to achieve a particular goal
* External System: Integrates with the Teams platform to retrieve or send data, or to perform a specific action
* Response: Returns a result or notification to the user, indicating the outcome of the workflow or action

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Triggering from Teams Commands include:
* Creating new tasks or projects
* Sending notifications or alerts
* Retrieving information from external systems
* Initiating workflows or business processes
* Integrating with other Microsoft products or services

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Triggering from Teams Commands include:
* Overly complex or convoluted workflows
* Insufficient error handling or logging
* Lack of security or authentication mechanisms
* Poorly designed or unclear commands or triggers
* Inadequate testing or validation of workflows or actions
