# 50. Shared Channels Integration

Canonical documentation for 50. Shared Channels Integration. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 50. Shared Channels Integration exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Shared Channels Integration is to facilitate seamless communication and data exchange between different systems, applications, or services through a unified channel. This integration addresses the problem of information silos, where data is isolated within individual systems, and enables real-time collaboration, improved productivity, and enhanced customer experiences. The class of problems it addresses includes data duplication, inconsistent information, and lack of visibility across different systems.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Shared Channels Integration is based on a hub-and-spoke architecture, where a central hub connects multiple systems, applications, or services, enabling them to share data, events, and messages in real-time. This architecture allows for loose coupling between systems, enabling flexibility, scalability, and fault tolerance. The integration layer provides a standardized interface for systems to interact with each other, abstracting away the complexities of individual system protocols and formats.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Shared Channel | A unified communication pathway that enables multiple systems, applications, or services to exchange data, events, and messages in real-time. |
| Integration Layer | A standardized interface that abstracts away the complexities of individual system protocols and formats, enabling seamless communication between systems. |
| System | An application, service, or platform that participates in the Shared Channels Integration. |
| Event | A significant occurrence or change in state that is shared between systems through the integration layer. |
| Message | A unit of data that is exchanged between systems through the integration layer. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Shared Channels Integration include:
* **Decoupling**: Systems are loosely coupled, enabling flexibility, scalability, and fault tolerance.
* **Standardization**: A standardized interface is provided for systems to interact with each other, abstracting away individual system protocols and formats.
* **Real-time Data Exchange**: Systems can exchange data, events, and messages in real-time, enabling timely decision-making and improved productivity.
* **Event-Driven Architecture**: The integration layer is designed to handle events and messages, enabling systems to respond to changes in state and significant occurrences.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Shared Channels Integration is based on a publish-subscribe pattern, where systems publish events and messages to a shared channel, and other systems subscribe to receive these events and messages. This model enables loose coupling between systems and provides a scalable and fault-tolerant architecture.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Shared Channels Integration include:
* **Request-Response Pattern**: Systems send requests to each other and receive responses in real-time.
* **Event-Driven Pattern**: Systems publish events and messages to a shared channel, and other systems respond to these events.
* **Data Replication Pattern**: Systems replicate data in real-time, ensuring consistency and accuracy across different systems.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Shared Channels Integration include:
* **Tight Coupling**: Systems are tightly coupled, making it difficult to modify or replace individual systems without affecting others.
* **Point-to-Point Integration**: Systems are integrated using point-to-point connections, leading to complexity, rigidity, and scalability issues.
* **Data Duplication**: Data is duplicated across multiple systems, leading to inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and data management issues.
