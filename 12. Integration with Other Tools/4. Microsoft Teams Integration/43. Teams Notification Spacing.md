## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 43. Teams Notification Spacing exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of Teams Notification Spacing is to provide a standardized approach to managing the timing and frequency of notifications within Microsoft Teams, addressing the problem of notification overload and improving the overall user experience. This feature aims to reduce distractions, minimize interruptions, and enhance productivity by allowing users to control the spacing of notifications.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Teams Notification Spacing operates on the principle of adjustable time intervals, enabling users to set the frequency at which they receive notifications. This model involves a simple, intuitive configuration that allows users to customize their notification experience, striking a balance between staying informed and avoiding unnecessary disruptions.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Notification Spacing | The feature that allows users to set a specific time interval between notifications. |
| Notification Interval | The adjustable time period between notifications. |
| Default Interval | The pre-set time interval for notification spacing that is applied when no custom setting is chosen. |
| Custom Interval | A user-defined time interval for notification spacing. |
| Notification Threshold | The maximum number of notifications that can be received within a set interval before the spacing feature intervenes. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Teams Notification Spacing include:
- **Customizability**: The ability for users to adjust notification intervals according to their preferences or work requirements.
- **Flexibility**: The capacity of the system to adapt to different user needs, such as varying notification intervals based on the time of day or day of the week.
- **Interruption Management**: The principle of managing when and how notifications are delivered to minimize disruptions and enhance user focus.

## 5. Standard Model

This model also includes options for users to choose when they receive notifications, such as during work hours only, to further tailor their experience.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in using Teams Notification Spacing include:
- Setting a longer notification interval during focused work sessions to minimize distractions.
