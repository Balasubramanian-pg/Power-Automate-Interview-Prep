Canonical documentation for 51. Handling Message Deleted Events. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 51. Handling Message Deleted Events exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of handling message deleted events is to provide a mechanism for detecting and responding to the deletion of messages in a messaging system. This is crucial in maintaining data consistency, ensuring audit trails, and triggering follow-up actions. The problem space includes scenarios where messages are deleted accidentally or intentionally, and the system needs to take appropriate actions to mitigate any negative consequences.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Handling message deleted events involves a notification mechanism that alerts the system when a message is deleted. This notification can be used to trigger various actions, such as updating message status, notifying users, or initiating workflows. The conceptual model consists of message producers, message consumers, and a messaging system that facilitates communication between them. When a message is deleted, the messaging system generates a deleted event that is propagated to interested parties.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Message | A unit of data exchanged between systems or applications. |
| Message Deleted Event | A notification generated by the messaging system when a message is deleted. |
| Message Producer | An entity that creates and sends messages to the messaging system. |
| Message Consumer | An entity that receives and processes messages from the messaging system. |
| Messaging System | A platform that enables message exchange between producers and consumers. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of handling message deleted events include:
* **Message deletion detection**: The ability of the messaging system to detect when a message is deleted.
* **Event notification**: The mechanism by which the messaging system notifies interested parties of message deletion.
* **Event handling**: The actions taken by the system in response to a message deleted event.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for handling message deleted events involves the following steps:
1. **Message deletion**: A message is deleted from the messaging system.
2. **Event generation**: The messaging system generates a message deleted event.
3. **Event notification**: The event is notified to interested parties, such as message producers or consumers.
4. **Event handling**: The notified parties take appropriate actions in response to the event.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for handling message deleted events include:
* **Audit logging**: Logging message deleted events for auditing and compliance purposes.
* **Notification workflows**: Triggering workflows or notifications to users when a message is deleted.
* **Message status updates**: Updating the status of related messages or entities in response to a message deleted event.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for handling message deleted events include:
* **Ignoring deleted events**: Failing to handle or respond to message deleted events, leading to data inconsistencies or lost notifications.
* **Inconsistent event handling**: Handling message deleted events inconsistently across different parts of the system, leading to confusion or errors.
