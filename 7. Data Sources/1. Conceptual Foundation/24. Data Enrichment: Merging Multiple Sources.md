Canonical documentation for 24. Data Enrichment: Merging Multiple Sources. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 24. Data Enrichment: Merging Multiple Sources exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Data enrichment through merging multiple sources is a critical process that aims to enhance the quality, accuracy, and completeness of data by combining information from various sources. This process exists to address the common problem of data fragmentation, where relevant data is scattered across multiple systems, formats, or locations, making it difficult to obtain a unified view. By merging these sources, organizations can create a more comprehensive and reliable dataset, which is essential for informed decision-making, improved operations, and enhanced customer experiences.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of data enrichment through merging multiple sources involves several key steps: data identification, data extraction, data transformation, data merging, and data validation. It requires understanding the sources of data, the structure and quality of the data, and the rules for merging and transforming the data. This process leverages various technologies and techniques, including data integration tools, data quality tools, and data governance frameworks, to ensure that the resulting dataset is accurate, consistent, and usable.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Data Enrichment | The process of enhancing the quality and completeness of data by adding new data or merging existing data from multiple sources. |
| Data Source | An origin of data, which can be a database, file, API, or any other system that provides data. |
| Data Integration | The process of combining data from multiple sources into a unified view. |
| Data Quality | The measure of how well the data meets the requirements of its intended use, including aspects such as accuracy, completeness, and consistency. |
| Data Governance | The set of policies, procedures, and standards that ensure the effective and efficient use of data across an organization. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of data enrichment through merging multiple sources include understanding the data lifecycle, data quality dimensions, data integration patterns, and data governance principles. It involves recognizing the importance of data standardization, data normalization, and data validation to ensure that the merged data is reliable and consistent. Additionally, it requires an understanding of the technical and operational aspects of data merging, such as handling data duplicates, managing data inconsistencies, and ensuring data security and privacy.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for data enrichment through merging multiple sources typically involves the following stages: 
1. **Planning and Design**: Identifying the data sources, defining the data requirements, and designing the data integration architecture.
2. **Data Extraction**: Retrieving data from the identified sources, which may involve various extraction methods and tools.
3. **Data Transformation**: Converting the extracted data into a standardized format to facilitate merging and analysis.
4. **Data Merging**: Combining the transformed data from multiple sources into a unified dataset.
5. **Data Validation**: Verifying the quality and accuracy of the merged data to ensure it meets the intended use requirements.
6. **Data Deployment**: Making the enriched data available to the intended users or systems.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in data enrichment through merging multiple sources include:
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: A traditional pattern used for data integration, where data is extracted from sources, transformed into a standardized format, and loaded into a target system.
- **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)**: A modern pattern that loads the extracted data into a target system and then transforms it, often used in big data and cloud-based architectures.
- **Data Virtualization**: A pattern that provides a unified view of data from multiple sources without physically moving or copying the data.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in data enrichment through merging multiple sources include:
- **Lack of Data Governance**: Failing to establish clear policies, procedures, and standards for data management, leading to data quality issues and integration challenges.
- **Insufficient Data Quality Checks**: Not adequately validating and cleansing the data before merging, resulting in poor data quality and potential errors in analysis or decision-making.
- **Inadequate Security Measures**: Failing to implement appropriate security and privacy measures, putting sensitive data at risk of unauthorized access or breaches.
