# 11. Parsing JSON to Create Dynamic Content

Canonical documentation for 11. Parsing JSON to Create Dynamic Content. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 11. Parsing JSON to Create Dynamic Content exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Parsing JSON to create dynamic content exists to address the need for flexible and efficient data exchange between systems, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive web applications. The class of problems it addresses includes data serialization, deserialization, and manipulation, as well as the integration of data from various sources to generate dynamic content.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of parsing JSON to create dynamic content involves the following key components: data sources, JSON parsing, data manipulation, and content generation. Data sources provide the raw data, which is then parsed into a usable format using JSON parsing techniques. The parsed data is then manipulated and processed to generate dynamic content, such as web pages, user interfaces, or other interactive elements.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| JSON | JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data interchange format |
| Parsing | The process of analyzing and interpreting JSON data to extract meaningful information |
| Dynamic Content | Content that is generated or updated in real-time, based on user input, data changes, or other factors |
| Data Source | A system, application, or repository that provides data, such as a database, API, or file |
| Data Manipulation | The process of transforming, filtering, or sorting data to prepare it for content generation |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of parsing JSON to create dynamic content include:
* Data serialization and deserialization
* JSON schema and data validation
* Data transformation and manipulation
* Content generation and templating
* Error handling and debugging

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for parsing JSON to create dynamic content involves the following steps:
1. Data retrieval: Retrieve JSON data from a data source, such as an API or database.
2. JSON parsing: Parse the JSON data into a usable format, such as a JavaScript object or a data structure.
3. Data manipulation: Manipulate and process the parsed data to prepare it for content generation.
4. Content generation: Use the manipulated data to generate dynamic content, such as a web page or user interface.
5. Error handling: Handle errors and exceptions that may occur during the parsing, manipulation, or content generation process.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for parsing JSON to create dynamic content include:
* Using a JSON parser library or framework to simplify the parsing process
* Implementing data validation and error handling to ensure data consistency and reliability
* Using templating engines or content generation frameworks to separate presentation logic from data logic
* Caching parsed data or generated content to improve performance and reduce latency

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for parsing JSON to create dynamic content include:
* Using eval() or other insecure methods to parse JSON data
* Failing to validate or sanitize user-input data
* Using overly complex or nested data structures that are difficult to parse or manipulate
* Ignoring error handling or debugging, leading to fragile or unreliable applications
