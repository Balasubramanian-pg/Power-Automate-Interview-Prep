Canonical documentation for 25. Best Practices for Documenting Data Structures. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 25. Best Practices for Documenting Data Structures exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of documenting data structures is to provide a clear understanding of the organization, relationships, and constraints of data elements within a system. This documentation exists to address the class of problems related to data complexity, ambiguity, and inconsistency, which can lead to errors, misunderstandings, and difficulties in maintaining and evolving systems.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual model of documenting data structures involves understanding the data elements, their relationships, and the rules that govern them. It encompasses the identification, definition, and organization of data structures, as well as the documentation of their properties, constraints, and behaviors. This model serves as a foundation for communicating data structure information to stakeholders, including developers, users, and maintainers.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Data Structure | A collection of organized data elements, such as arrays, lists, trees, or graphs, that provide a way to store and manage data. |
| Data Element | A single unit of data, such as a variable, attribute, or field, that has a specific meaning and purpose within a data structure. |
| Data Type | A classification of data elements based on their format, size, and range of values, such as integer, string, or date. |
| Constraint | A rule or restriction that applies to a data element or data structure, such as a primary key, foreign key, or validation rule. |
| Data Model | A conceptual representation of the data structures and relationships within a system, used to guide the design and implementation of the system. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of documenting data structures include:
* **Data structure identification**: identifying the data structures used within a system, including their components, relationships, and constraints.
* **Data element definition**: defining the properties and characteristics of each data element, including its data type, format, and any applicable constraints.
* **Relationship modeling**: modeling the relationships between data structures and data elements, including associations, aggregations, and compositions.
* **Constraint specification**: specifying the constraints that apply to data elements and data structures, including validation rules, primary and foreign keys, and referential integrity.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for documenting data structures involves using a combination of textual and visual representations, such as:
* **Entity-relationship diagrams**: visual representations of data structures and relationships.
* **Data dictionaries**: textual descriptions of data elements and their properties.
* **Data flow diagrams**: visual representations of data flows and transformations.
* **Object-oriented models**: representations of data structures and relationships using object-oriented concepts, such as classes and objects.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for documenting data structures include:
* **Using standardized notation**: using standardized notation systems, such as UML or ERD, to represent data structures and relationships.
* **Providing data element descriptions**: providing clear and concise descriptions of each data element, including its purpose, format, and any applicable constraints.
* **Including relationship information**: including information about the relationships between data structures and data elements, such as associations, aggregations, and compositions.
* **Using visual representations**: using visual representations, such as diagrams and charts, to illustrate complex data structures and relationships.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Common anti-patterns for documenting data structures include:
* **Insufficient detail**: providing insufficient detail about data structures and relationships, leading to ambiguity and confusion.
* **Inconsistent notation**: using inconsistent notation systems or terminology, leading to confusion and misunderstandings.
* **Lack of standardization**: failing to use standardized notation systems or terminology, leading to difficulties in communicating and maintaining data structure information.
* **Outdated documentation**: failing to keep documentation up-to-date, leading to discrepancies between the documentation and the actual data structures.
