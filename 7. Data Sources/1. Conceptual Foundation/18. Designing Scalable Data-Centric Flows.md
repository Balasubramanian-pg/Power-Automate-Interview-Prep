## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 18. Designing Scalable Data-Centric Flows exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of designing scalable data-centric flows is to create systems that can efficiently handle large volumes of data, scale to meet growing demands, and provide reliable and consistent data processing. The class of problems it addresses includes data processing bottlenecks, scalability issues, and data consistency problems. Scalable data-centric flows are essential in various domains, such as big data analytics, real-time processing, and data-driven decision-making.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of designing scalable data-centric flows involves understanding the key components and interactions within a data processing system. It includes data sources, data processing engines, data storage systems, and data consumers. A scalable data-centric flow should be able to handle increasing data volumes, velocities, and varieties while maintaining low latency, high throughput, and fault tolerance.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Data Centricity | An architectural approach that prioritizes data as the primary asset, focusing on data creation, processing, storage, and consumption. |
| Scalability | The ability of a system to handle increased load, data volume, or user growth without compromising performance. |
| Data Flow | A series of processes that extract data from sources, transform it into a desired format, and load it into target systems for analysis or consumption. |
| ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) | A data integration process that extracts data from multiple sources, transforms it into a standardized format, and loads it into a target system. |
| Data Pipeline | A set of processes that move data from source systems to target systems, often involving data processing, transformation, and storage. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of designing scalable data-centric flows include:
* **Data Ingestion**: The process of collecting and transporting data from various sources to a central location for processing and storage.
* **Data Processing**: The act of transforming, aggregating, and analyzing data to extract insights and meaningful information.
* **Data Storage**: The management of data in a scalable and performant manner, using storage solutions such as relational databases, NoSQL databases, or data warehouses.
* **Data Consumption**: The process of making data available to end-users, applications, or services for analysis, reporting, or decision-making.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for designing scalable data-centric flows typically involves the following components:
* **Data Sources**: Various systems, applications, or devices that generate data, such as sensors, logs, or user interactions.
* **Data Ingestion Layer**: A layer responsible for collecting, processing, and transporting data from sources to a central location.
* **Data Processing Layer**: A layer that transforms, aggregates, and analyzes data to extract insights and meaningful information.
* **Data Storage Layer**: A layer that manages data in a scalable and performant manner, using storage solutions such as relational databases, NoSQL databases, or data warehouses.
* **Data Consumption Layer**: A layer that makes data available to end-users, applications, or services for analysis, reporting, or decision-making.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in designing scalable data-centric flows include:
* **Batch Processing**: Processing data in batches to improve efficiency and reduce latency.
* **Stream Processing**: Processing data in real-time as it is generated to enable timely insights and decision-making.
* **Micro-Batching**: Processing data in small batches to balance efficiency and latency.
* **Data Lake Architecture**: Storing raw, unprocessed data in a centralized repository for later processing and analysis.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in designing scalable data-centric flows include:
* **Tight Coupling**: Closely coupling data sources, processing engines, and storage systems, making it difficult to scale or modify individual components.
* **Over-Engineering**: Over-designing systems to handle extreme scenarios, leading to unnecessary complexity and increased costs.
* **Under-Engineering**: Under-designing systems, leading to performance issues, scalability problems, and data losses.
* **Lack of Monitoring**: Failing to monitor system performance, data quality, and latency, making it difficult to identify and address issues.
