Canonical documentation for 19. Mapping Data Between Heterogeneous Systems. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 19. Mapping Data Between Heterogeneous Systems exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of mapping data between heterogeneous systems is to enable seamless communication and data exchange between different systems, applications, or platforms that have distinct data formats, structures, or protocols. This is essential in today's interconnected world, where organizations rely on multiple systems to operate efficiently. The problem space includes integrating data from various sources, such as databases, APIs, or files, and transforming it into a compatible format for consumption by other systems.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Mapping data between heterogeneous systems involves a series of steps, including data discovery, data mapping, data transformation, and data exchange. It requires a deep understanding of the source and target systems, their data models, and the relationships between them. The process can be complex, involving multiple data formats, protocols, and standards, and may require additional components, such as data warehouses, ETL tools, or APIs.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Data Mapping | The process of creating a correspondence between two or more data models, enabling data exchange and transformation between them. |
| Data Transformation | The process of converting data from one format to another, including changes to data structure, format, or content. |
| Heterogeneous Systems | Systems, applications, or platforms that have distinct data formats, structures, or protocols, requiring data mapping and transformation to enable communication and data exchange. |
| Data Integration | The process of combining data from multiple sources into a unified view, enabling a single, comprehensive understanding of the data. |
| ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) | A process used to extract data from multiple sources, transform it into a compatible format, and load it into a target system. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of mapping data between heterogeneous systems include:
* Data discovery: identifying and understanding the source and target systems, their data models, and the relationships between them.
* Data mapping: creating a correspondence between the source and target data models, enabling data exchange and transformation.
* Data transformation: converting data from one format to another, including changes to data structure, format, or content.
* Data exchange: transferring data between systems, using protocols and standards such as APIs, messaging queues, or file transfers.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for mapping data between heterogeneous systems involves the following steps:
1. Data discovery and analysis
2. Data mapping and transformation
3. Data exchange and integration
4. Data quality and validation
5. Data governance and monitoring

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in mapping data between heterogeneous systems include:
* Using ETL tools to extract, transform, and load data between systems
* Implementing data warehouses to integrate and store data from multiple sources
* Utilizing APIs and messaging queues to enable real-time data exchange and integration
* Applying data governance and quality control measures to ensure data accuracy and consistency

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in mapping data between heterogeneous systems include:
* Using manual data entry or spreadsheet-based data integration, which can be error-prone and inefficient
* Ignoring data governance and quality control measures, leading to data inconsistencies and inaccuracies
* Failing to document data mapping and transformation processes, making it difficult to maintain and update the system
* Using proprietary or custom data formats, which can limit data exchange and integration with other systems
