> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 13. Handling Null Values in Data Streams exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Handling null values in data streams is a critical aspect of data processing and analysis. Null values, also known as missing or undefined values, can occur in data streams due to various reasons such as data entry errors, sensor malfunctions, or data integration issues. If not handled properly, null values can lead to incorrect analysis, biased models, and poor decision-making. The purpose of handling null values in data streams is to ensure that the data is accurate, complete, and reliable, thereby enabling informed decision-making and effective data-driven insights.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of handling null values in data streams involves identifying, processing, and replacing null values with suitable alternatives. This process typically involves data profiling, data cleaning, and data transformation. Data profiling helps to identify the frequency, distribution, and patterns of null values, while data cleaning involves removing or replacing null values with meaningful alternatives. Data transformation involves converting the cleaned data into a suitable format for analysis or modeling.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Null Value | A missing or undefined value in a data stream |
| Data Stream | A continuous flow of data from various sources |
| Data Profiling | The process of analyzing data to identify patterns, trends, and distributions |
| Data Cleaning | The process of removing or replacing null values with meaningful alternatives |
| Data Transformation | The process of converting cleaned data into a suitable format for analysis or modeling |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of handling null values in data streams include:
* **Null value identification**: Identifying the presence and frequency of null values in a data stream
* **Null value replacement**: Replacing null values with suitable alternatives, such as mean, median, or imputed values
* **Data quality metrics**: Measuring the quality of the data stream, including metrics such as completeness, accuracy, and consistency
* **Data processing workflows**: Developing workflows that handle null values, including data profiling, data cleaning, and data transformation

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for handling null values in data streams involves the following steps:
1. **Data ingestion**: Ingesting data from various sources into a data stream
2. **Data profiling**: Analyzing the data stream to identify patterns, trends, and distributions
3. **Null value identification**: Identifying the presence and frequency of null values
4. **Null value replacement**: Replacing null values with suitable alternatives
5. **Data transformation**: Converting the cleaned data into a suitable format for analysis or modeling
6. **Data quality metrics**: Measuring the quality of the data stream

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for handling null values in data streams include:
* **Mean/Median imputation**: Replacing null values with the mean or median of the respective column
* **Regression imputation**: Replacing null values with predicted values based on regression models
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation**: Replacing null values with values from similar data points
* **Data interpolation**: Replacing null values with interpolated values based on surrounding data points

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for handling null values in data streams include:
* **Ignoring null values**: Ignoring null values without proper handling or replacement
* **Deleting rows with null values**: Deleting rows with null values without proper analysis or replacement
* **Using arbitrary replacement values**: Using arbitrary replacement values without proper analysis or justification
