> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 5. Troubleshooting Data with Compose exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of troubleshooting data with Compose is to identify and resolve issues that arise during the data processing and composition pipeline. Compose is a powerful tool for building and managing data pipelines, but like any complex system, it can be prone to errors and inconsistencies. The problem space addressed by this topic includes data quality issues, pipeline failures, and performance optimization. By providing a structured approach to troubleshooting, Compose enables developers and data engineers to quickly identify and resolve problems, ensuring that their data pipelines are reliable, efficient, and scalable.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of troubleshooting data with Compose involves a combination of data pipeline architecture, data quality control, and performance monitoring. It requires a deep understanding of the Compose framework, including its components, configuration options, and dependencies. The mental model should include the following key elements: data sources, data processing, data storage, and data visualization. By understanding how these elements interact and impact each other, developers can identify potential bottlenecks and troubleshoot issues more effectively.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Compose | A framework for building and managing data pipelines |
| Data Pipeline | A series of processes that extract, transform, and load data from multiple sources |
| Data Quality | The measure of how accurate, complete, and consistent the data is |
| Performance Optimization | The process of improving the speed and efficiency of data processing and composition |
| Troubleshooting | The process of identifying and resolving issues that arise during data processing and composition |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of troubleshooting data with Compose include: (1) understanding the data pipeline architecture, (2) identifying data quality issues, (3) monitoring performance metrics, (4) using logging and debugging tools, and (5) applying optimization techniques. These concepts are fundamental to the troubleshooting process and provide a foundation for more advanced techniques and strategies.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for troubleshooting data with Compose involves the following steps: (1) identify the issue, (2) gather information, (3) analyze the data, (4) develop a hypothesis, (5) test the hypothesis, and (6) implement a solution. This model provides a structured approach to troubleshooting and ensures that developers and data engineers follow a consistent and methodical process.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in troubleshooting data with Compose include: (1) using data quality checks to identify inconsistencies, (2) applying performance optimization techniques to improve processing speed, (3) leveraging logging and debugging tools to identify issues, and (4) implementing data validation and verification processes to ensure accuracy. These patterns are widely accepted and provide a foundation for effective troubleshooting.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in troubleshooting data with Compose include: (1) ignoring data quality issues, (2) neglecting performance optimization, (3) failing to use logging and debugging tools, and (4) implementing ad-hoc or untested solutions. These practices can lead to further issues, decreased performance, and increased maintenance costs.
