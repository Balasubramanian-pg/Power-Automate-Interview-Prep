# 21. Understanding JSON Brackets: {} vs []

Canonical documentation for 21. Understanding JSON Brackets: {} vs []. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 21. Understanding JSON Brackets: {} vs [] exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of understanding JSON brackets is to clarify the distinction between the two primary bracket types used in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data interchange format. The problem space revolves around the confusion and misuse of curly brackets `{}` and square brackets `[]` in JSON data structures, which can lead to parsing errors, data corruption, and integration issues.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that uses a text-based representation to exchange data between systems. It relies on two primary data structures: objects (represented using curly brackets `{}`) and arrays (represented using square brackets `[]`). Understanding the roles and usage of these brackets is essential for working with JSON data effectively.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| JSON | JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data interchange format. |
| Object | An unordered collection of key-value pairs, represented using curly brackets `{}`. |
| Array | An ordered collection of values, represented using square brackets `[]`. |
| Key | A string that identifies a value in a JSON object. |
| Value | A string, number, boolean, object, array, or null that is associated with a key in a JSON object. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of JSON brackets involve understanding the difference between objects and arrays. Objects are used to represent unordered collections of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and maps to a specific value. Arrays, on the other hand, are used to represent ordered collections of values, which can be of any data type, including strings, numbers, booleans, objects, and other arrays.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for using JSON brackets involves using curly brackets `{}` to enclose objects and square brackets `[]` to enclose arrays. This model is widely adopted and recommended for JSON data interchange.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for using JSON brackets include:
* Using objects to represent configuration data, where each key-value pair represents a setting or property.
* Using arrays to represent collections of data, such as lists of items or records.
* Nesting objects and arrays to represent complex data structures, such as hierarchical or relational data.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Common anti-patterns for using JSON brackets include:
* Using arrays to represent key-value pairs, which can lead to confusion and errors.
* Using objects to represent ordered collections of data, which can lead to inconsistencies and parsing issues.
* Failing to properly nest or close brackets, which can result in parsing errors and data corruption.
