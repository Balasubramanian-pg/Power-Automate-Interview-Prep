# 7. Working with Objects vs Arrays

Canonical documentation for 7. Working with Objects vs Arrays. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 7. Working with Objects vs Arrays exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Working with Objects vs Arrays exists to provide guidance on when to use objects and when to use arrays in programming. The class of problems it addresses includes data structure selection, data modeling, and optimization of code for readability, maintainability, and performance. This topic is crucial because the choice between objects and arrays can significantly impact the complexity, scalability, and efficiency of software applications.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
At a high level, working with objects vs arrays involves understanding the fundamental differences between these two data structures and applying that understanding to make informed decisions about which to use in various contexts. Objects are typically used to represent complex, structured data with named properties, while arrays are often used for collections of similar data. The choice between the two depends on the specific requirements of the application, including the need for data structure flexibility, the importance of data relationships, and performance considerations.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Object | A data structure that represents a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and maps to a specific value. |
| Array | A data structure that represents an ordered collection of values, which can be of any data type, including strings, numbers, booleans, objects, and other arrays. |
| Data Structure | A way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be efficiently accessed and modified. |
| JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) | A lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. |
| Serialization | The process of converting a data structure or object into a format that can be written to a file or transmitted across a network. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of working with objects vs arrays include understanding the trade-offs between flexibility and performance, recognizing the importance of data relationships and structure, and being aware of the serialization and deserialization implications of each data structure. Additionally, it's crucial to consider the programming language's support for objects and arrays, as different languages may have different capabilities and optimizations for these data structures.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for working with objects vs arrays involves using objects when the data has a complex, structured format with named properties, and using arrays when the data is a collection of similar items. This model also recommends considering the specific requirements of the application, including performance, scalability, and maintainability, when making decisions about data structure selection.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for working with objects vs arrays include using objects to represent configuration data, user profiles, or complex data entities, and using arrays to represent lists of items, such as search results, product catalogs, or log entries. Another pattern is to use arrays of objects to represent collections of complex data entities, such as a list of user profiles or a collection of product information.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Common anti-patterns for working with objects vs arrays include using arrays to represent complex, structured data, using objects to represent large collections of similar data, and neglecting to consider performance and scalability implications when selecting a data structure. Another anti-pattern is to use objects or arrays unnecessarily, such as using an object to represent a single value or using an array to represent a small, fixed collection of items.
