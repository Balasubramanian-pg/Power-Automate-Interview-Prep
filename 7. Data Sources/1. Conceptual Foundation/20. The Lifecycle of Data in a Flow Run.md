# 20. The Lifecycle of Data in a Flow Run

Canonical documentation for 20. The Lifecycle of Data in a Flow Run. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 20. The Lifecycle of Data in a Flow Run exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The lifecycle of data in a flow run is a critical concept that addresses the challenges of managing data as it flows through a series of processes, transformations, and storage systems. It provides a framework for understanding how data is created, processed, stored, and ultimately disposed of, ensuring data quality, integrity, and compliance with regulatory requirements. The primary problems this concept addresses include data loss, data corruption, and data leakage, which can have significant consequences for organizations.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The lifecycle of data in a flow run can be visualized as a series of stages, including data ingestion, processing, storage, and disposal. Each stage involves a set of activities, such as data validation, transformation, and encryption, which ensure the data is handled correctly and securely. The lifecycle is typically triggered by an event, such as a user request or a scheduled job, and is managed by a workflow engine or a data pipeline.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Data Ingestion | The process of collecting and transporting data from various sources into a flow run. |
| Data Processing | The stage where data is transformed, validated, and enriched to prepare it for storage or further analysis. |
| Data Storage | The stage where data is persisted in a repository, such as a database or a data warehouse. |
| Data Disposal | The process of securely deleting or archiving data that is no longer needed or required. |
| Workflow Engine | A software component that manages the flow of data and activities within a flow run. |
| Data Pipeline | A series of processes and systems that extract, transform, and load data from one system to another. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of the lifecycle of data in a flow run include data provenance, data lineage, and data governance. Data provenance refers to the origin and history of the data, while data lineage refers to the sequence of processes and transformations applied to the data. Data governance refers to the policies, procedures, and standards that ensure data quality, security, and compliance.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for the lifecycle of data in a flow run involves the following stages: data ingestion, data processing, data storage, and data disposal. Each stage is designed to ensure data quality, security, and compliance, and is typically managed by a workflow engine or a data pipeline. The model also includes feedback loops and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to errors or anomalies.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in the lifecycle of data in a flow run include the use of data validation and data transformation techniques, such as data masking and data encryption, to protect sensitive data. Another pattern is the use of data warehousing and business intelligence tools to analyze and visualize data, and to support decision-making.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in the lifecycle of data in a flow run include the use of hardcoded passwords or credentials, the lack of data encryption or access controls, and the failure to implement data backup and recovery mechanisms. Another anti-pattern is the use of outdated or unsupported software components, which can introduce security vulnerabilities and compromise data integrity.
