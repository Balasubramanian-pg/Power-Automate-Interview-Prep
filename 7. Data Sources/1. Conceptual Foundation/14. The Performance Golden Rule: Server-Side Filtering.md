# 14. The Performance Golden Rule: Server-Side Filtering

Canonical documentation for 14. The Performance Golden Rule: Server-Side Filtering. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 14. The Performance Golden Rule: Server-Side Filtering exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The Performance Golden Rule: Server-Side Filtering exists to address the problem of inefficient data retrieval and processing in applications. By filtering data on the server-side, applications can reduce the amount of data transferred over the network, decrease the load on the client, and improve overall performance. This approach is particularly important in scenarios where large amounts of data are involved, such as in big data analytics, data warehousing, and real-time web applications.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
The conceptual overview of Server-Side Filtering involves a simple yet powerful idea: instead of retrieving all data from the server and then filtering it on the client-side, the filtering is done on the server-side, and only the relevant data is sent to the client. This approach requires a clear understanding of the data, the filtering criteria, and the application's requirements. It also involves designing an efficient filtering mechanism that can handle large amounts of data and complex filtering conditions.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Server-Side Filtering | The process of filtering data on the server before sending it to the client. |
| Client-Side Filtering | The process of filtering data on the client after receiving it from the server. |
| Data Retrieval | The process of fetching data from a data source, such as a database or a file. |
| Filtering Criteria | The conditions used to filter data, such as search queries, filters, or sorting options. |
| Performance Optimization | The process of improving the efficiency and speed of an application or system. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Server-Side Filtering include:
* **Data retrieval**: The process of fetching data from a data source.
* **Filtering**: The process of selecting a subset of data based on specific conditions.
* **Server-side processing**: The process of performing computations and data processing on the server.
* **Client-server architecture**: The design pattern that separates the application into a client and a server, with the client requesting data and the server providing it.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Server-Side Filtering involves the following steps:
1. **Receive request**: The server receives a request from the client, including any filtering criteria.
2. **Retrieve data**: The server retrieves the relevant data from the data source.
3. **Apply filtering**: The server applies the filtering criteria to the retrieved data.
4. **Send response**: The server sends the filtered data to the client.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns for Server-Side Filtering include:
* **Pagination**: Retrieving data in smaller chunks, with each chunk representing a page of results.
* **Sorting**: Sorting data based on specific criteria, such as alphabetical or numerical order.
* **Searching**: Retrieving data based on a search query or keyword.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns for Server-Side Filtering include:
* **Retrieving all data**: Retrieving all data from the server and then filtering it on the client-side.
* **Using client-side filtering**: Filtering data on the client-side, rather than on the server-side.
* **Not optimizing database queries**: Failing to optimize database queries, resulting in slow performance and inefficient data retrieval.
