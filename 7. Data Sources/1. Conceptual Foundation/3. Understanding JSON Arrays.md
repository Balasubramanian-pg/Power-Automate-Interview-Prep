# 3. Understanding JSON Arrays

Canonical documentation for 3. Understanding JSON Arrays. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 3. Understanding JSON Arrays exists and the class of problems it addresses.
JSON Arrays are a fundamental component of the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data interchange format, which is widely used for exchanging and storing data between web servers, web applications, and mobile apps. The purpose of JSON Arrays is to provide a lightweight, easy-to-read, and easy-to-write format for representing collections of data. The problem space that JSON Arrays address includes the need for a simple, flexible, and efficient way to store and transmit data, such as lists of items, tables of data, and other types of collections.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
JSON Arrays are ordered collections of values, which can be of any data type, including strings, numbers, booleans, objects, and other arrays. They are denoted by square brackets `[]` and are composed of a list of values separated by commas `,`. Each value in the array is assigned an index, which is a zero-based integer that identifies the position of the value in the array.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| JSON Array | An ordered collection of values, denoted by square brackets `[]` and composed of a list of values separated by commas `,`. |
| Element | A single value in a JSON Array, which can be of any data type, including strings, numbers, booleans, objects, and other arrays. |
| Index | A zero-based integer that identifies the position of an element in a JSON Array. |
| Array Literal | A JSON Array that is defined using the array literal syntax, which consists of a list of values enclosed in square brackets `[]`. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of JSON Arrays include:
* **Ordered collections**: JSON Arrays are ordered collections of values, which means that the order of the elements in the array is significant.
* **Indexed elements**: Each element in a JSON Array is assigned an index, which is a zero-based integer that identifies the position of the element in the array.
* **Data type flexibility**: JSON Arrays can contain elements of any data type, including strings, numbers, booleans, objects, and other arrays.
* **Array literal syntax**: JSON Arrays can be defined using the array literal syntax, which consists of a list of values enclosed in square brackets `[]`.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for JSON Arrays is to use the array literal syntax to define an array, and to access and manipulate the elements of the array using the index. For example:
```json
[
  "string",
  42,
  true,
  {
    "key": "value"
  },
  [
    "nested",
    "array"
  ]
]
```
This model is widely supported and recommended for use in most JSON-based applications.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Some common patterns for using JSON Arrays include:
* **Table-like data**: Using JSON Arrays to represent table-like data, such as a list of items or a table of values.
* **Configurable data**: Using JSON Arrays to represent configurable data, such as a list of options or a set of settings.
* **Nested data**: Using JSON Arrays to represent nested data, such as a list of objects or a tree-like structure.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Some common anti-patterns for using JSON Arrays include:
* **Using arrays as objects**: Using JSON Arrays as if they were objects, by assigning non-numeric indices to elements.
* **Using objects as arrays**: Using JSON Objects as if they were arrays, by assigning numeric indices to properties.
* **Deeply nesting arrays**: Using deeply nested JSON Arrays, which can make the data difficult to read and manipulate.
