# 6. Data Types: String Integer Float Boolean

Canonical documentation for 6. Data Types: String Integer Float Boolean. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 6. Data Types: String Integer Float Boolean exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of understanding data types such as String, Integer, Float, and Boolean is to effectively manage and manipulate data within various programming contexts. These data types address the problem of needing to store, process, and represent different kinds of information in a structured and meaningful way, ensuring that data is handled correctly and efficiently. This is crucial in software development, data analysis, and any field where data processing is fundamental.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
At a high level, data types can be thought of as categories or labels that define the type of value a variable can hold, the operations that can be performed on it, and how much memory it will occupy. Each data type has its own set of characteristics, such as the range of values it can represent, whether it can hold decimal points, or if it represents true or false states. This conceptual framework is essential for programming, as it dictates how data is stored, processed, and interacted with in a program.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| String | A sequence of characters, such as letters, numbers, or symbols, used to represent text. |
| Integer | A whole number, either positive, negative, or zero, without a fractional part. |
| Float | A number that has a fractional part, representing decimal numbers. |
| Boolean | A logical value that can have only two values: true or false. |
| Variable | A named storage location that holds a value. |
| Data Type | A classification of data based on its format, size, and set of values it can hold. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of data types include understanding the differences between primitive types (like Integer, Float, Boolean) and composite types (like String, which is composed of characters), recognizing the importance of type checking to prevent errors, and knowing how to convert between different data types when necessary. Additionally, understanding the memory allocation and the operations supported by each data type is crucial for efficient programming.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for working with data types involves declaring variables with specific types, using type-safe operations to manipulate these variables, and employing type conversion functions when changing the data type of a variable. This model emphasizes the importance of explicit type definitions to ensure clarity, prevent type-related bugs, and facilitate better code maintenance.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns include using Strings for text manipulation, Integers for counting or indexing, Floats for scientific or financial calculations, and Booleans for conditional logic. Another pattern is the use of type casting or conversion functions to change the data type of a variable, such as converting a String to an Integer for numerical operations.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in the use of data types include neglecting to declare variable types, which can lead to type confusion and errors, excessively using type conversions which can obscure code intent, and misusing data types, such as using a String to store numerical data. Another anti-pattern is ignoring the potential for overflow or underflow when performing operations on integers or floats.
