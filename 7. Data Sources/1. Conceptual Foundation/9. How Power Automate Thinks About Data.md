Canonical documentation for 9. How Power Automate Thinks About Data. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 9. How Power Automate Thinks About Data exists and the class of problems it addresses.
Power Automate thinks about data in a way that enables users to automate workflows, synchronize data between applications, and enhance business productivity. The primary problem space addressed by Power Automate's data handling is the integration of disparate data sources, services, and applications. This includes connecting to various data providers, transforming data formats, and applying business logic to drive automated workflows. By understanding how Power Automate thinks about data, users can effectively design, implement, and manage data-driven workflows that meet their specific business needs.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
At its core, Power Automate's data handling is based on a robust and flexible data model that supports a wide range of data types, formats, and sources. This model enables the platform to interact with various data providers, such as databases, APIs, and files, and to perform data transformations, validations, and mappings. The conceptual overview of Power Automate's data handling involves understanding the key components, including data sources, data types, data transformations, and data actions, which collectively facilitate the automation of data-driven workflows.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Action | A specific operation performed on data within a Power Automate workflow, such as creating, updating, or deleting data. |
| Connector | A pre-built interface that enables Power Automate to interact with a specific data source or service, such as a database or API. |
| Data Source | A system, application, or service that provides data to Power Automate, such as a database, file, or API. |
| Data Type | A specific format or structure of data, such as text, number, or date, that determines how the data is processed and stored. |
| Trigger | An event or condition that initiates a Power Automate workflow, such as the creation of a new record or the receipt of an email. |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of Power Automate's data handling include data sources, data types, data transformations, and data actions. Data sources provide the input data for workflows, while data types determine how the data is processed and stored. Data transformations enable the conversion of data from one format to another, and data actions perform specific operations on the data, such as creating, updating, or deleting records. Additionally, Power Automate's data handling involves understanding the concepts of triggers, actions, and connectors, which collectively facilitate the automation of data-driven workflows.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for Power Automate's data handling involves a structured approach to designing and implementing data-driven workflows. This includes identifying the data sources and targets, defining the data types and transformations, and configuring the data actions and triggers. The recommended model also involves using pre-built connectors and templates to simplify the integration of data sources and services, and to reduce the complexity of workflow design. Furthermore, the standard model emphasizes the importance of data validation, error handling, and security, to ensure that workflows are reliable, efficient, and secure.

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in Power Automate's data handling include the use of triggers to initiate workflows, the application of data transformations to convert data formats, and the use of actions to perform specific operations on data. Another common pattern is the use of connectors to integrate data sources and services, and the implementation of data validation and error handling mechanisms to ensure workflow reliability. Additionally, many users employ patterns such as data mapping, data aggregation, and data filtering to manipulate and analyze data within their workflows.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in Power Automate's data handling include the use of hardcoded data values, the lack of data validation and error handling, and the failure to implement security measures to protect sensitive data. Another common anti-pattern is the over-reliance on custom code and scripts, which can increase workflow complexity and maintenance costs. Additionally, the use of outdated or deprecated connectors and data sources can lead to workflow failures and data inconsistencies. It is also discouraged to ignore data governance and compliance requirements, such as data privacy and retention policies, when designing and implementing data-driven workflows.
