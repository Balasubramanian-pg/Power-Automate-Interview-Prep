# 2. The Anatomy of a JSON Object

Canonical documentation for 2. The Anatomy of a JSON Object. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 2. The Anatomy of a JSON Object exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) object is a fundamental data structure used for exchanging and storing data between web servers, web applications, and mobile apps. The purpose of understanding the anatomy of a JSON object is to effectively work with JSON data, which is a common problem space in software development, particularly in web and mobile application development. JSON objects address the need for a lightweight, human-readable, and easy-to-parse data format.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
A JSON object is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a string and each value can be a string, number, boolean, array, object, or null. JSON objects are often used to represent data in a structured and organized way, making it easy to access and manipulate the data. The conceptual overview of a JSON object includes understanding its basic structure, data types, and how it can be used to represent complex data.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| JSON | JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data interchange format |
| Object | An unordered collection of key-value pairs |
| Key | A string that identifies a value in a JSON object |
| Value | A string, number, boolean, array, object, or null that is associated with a key |
| Array | An ordered collection of values |
| Parse | To analyze a JSON string and convert it into a usable data structure |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of a JSON object include:
* **Key-value pairs**: The basic building block of a JSON object, where each key is a string and each value can be a variety of data types.
* **Data types**: JSON supports several data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and null.
* **Nested objects**: JSON objects can contain other JSON objects, allowing for complex data structures.
* **Arrays**: JSON arrays are ordered collections of values that can be used to represent lists or collections of data.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for a JSON object is a simple, human-readable format that consists of key-value pairs, where each key is a string and each value is a valid JSON data type. The recommended model includes:
* Using double quotes to enclose keys and string values
* Using commas to separate key-value pairs
* Using colons to separate keys from values
* Using brackets to enclose arrays
* Using curly braces to enclose objects

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in JSON objects include:
* **Using meaningful key names**: Choosing key names that accurately describe the data they represent.
* **Using consistent data types**: Using consistent data types for similar data, such as using strings for names and numbers for quantities.
* **Using arrays for lists**: Using JSON arrays to represent lists or collections of data.
* **Using nested objects for complex data**: Using nested objects to represent complex data structures.

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Anti-patterns in JSON objects include:
* **Using unnecessary complexity**: Using nested objects or arrays when a simple key-value pair would suffice.
* **Using inconsistent data types**: Using different data types for similar data, such as using strings for some names and numbers for others.
* **Using duplicate keys**: Using duplicate keys in a JSON object, which can lead to data loss or corruption.
* **Using invalid characters**: Using invalid characters, such as tabs or newline characters, in JSON strings.
