# 12. Generating JSON Schema from Samples

Canonical documentation for 12. Generating JSON Schema from Samples. This document defines the conceptual model, terminology, and standard usage patterns.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is implementation-agnostic and intended to serve as a stable reference.

## 1. Purpose and Problem Space
Describe why 12. Generating JSON Schema from Samples exists and the class of problems it addresses.
The purpose of generating JSON schema from samples is to create a formal definition of a JSON document's structure, which can be used for validation, documentation, and code generation. This addresses the problem of ensuring data consistency and preventing errors when working with JSON data. Without a schema, it can be challenging to validate JSON data, leading to potential issues with data integrity and reliability.

## 2. Conceptual Overview
Provide a high-level mental model of the topic.
Generating JSON schema from samples involves analyzing a set of JSON data samples to identify patterns and structures, and then using that information to create a schema that defines the expected format of the data. This process can be automated using specialized tools and algorithms, which can help to reduce the complexity and effort required to create a schema.

## 3. Terminology and Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| JSON Schema | A vocabulary that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents |
| Sample Data | A set of JSON data examples used to generate a schema |
| Validation | The process of checking a JSON document against a schema to ensure it conforms to the expected structure |
| Inference | The process of automatically generating a schema from sample data |
| Annotation | The process of adding metadata to a schema to provide additional context and meaning |

## 4. Core Concepts
Explain the fundamental ideas that form the basis of this topic.
The core concepts of generating JSON schema from samples include:
* **Inference**: The ability to automatically generate a schema from sample data, without requiring manual intervention.
* **Validation**: The process of checking a JSON document against a schema to ensure it conforms to the expected structure.
* **Annotation**: The process of adding metadata to a schema to provide additional context and meaning.
* **Pattern recognition**: The ability to identify patterns and structures in sample data, and use that information to generate a schema.

## 5. Standard Model
Describe the generally accepted or recommended model.
The standard model for generating JSON schema from samples involves the following steps:
1. Collecting a set of sample JSON data
2. Analyzing the sample data to identify patterns and structures
3. Using a schema generation tool or algorithm to create a schema from the sample data
4. Refining and annotating the schema as needed
5. Validating the schema against additional sample data to ensure its accuracy and completeness

## 6. Common Patterns
Document recurring, accepted patterns.
Common patterns in generating JSON schema from samples include:
* Using a large set of diverse sample data to improve the accuracy of the generated schema
* Using automated tools and algorithms to generate and refine the schema
* Validating the schema against multiple sets of sample data to ensure its robustness and reliability
* Using annotation and metadata to provide additional context and meaning to the schema

## 7. Anti-Patterns
Describe common but discouraged practices.
Common anti-patterns in generating JSON schema from samples include:
* Using a small or limited set of sample data, which can lead to an incomplete or inaccurate schema
* Manually creating a schema without using automated tools or algorithms, which can be time-consuming and error-prone
* Failing to validate the schema against additional sample data, which can lead to errors and inconsistencies
* Overly complicating the schema with unnecessary annotations or metadata, which can make it difficult to understand and use
